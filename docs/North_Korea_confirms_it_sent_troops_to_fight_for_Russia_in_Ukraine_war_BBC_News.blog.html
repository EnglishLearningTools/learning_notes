<p>And John, on the role of North Korea, this is the first time that Pyongyang has acknowledged its part in the war.</p>
<p>约翰，关于朝鲜的角色，这是平壤首次承认参与战争。</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, for some time now, Western intelligence officials have suggested that there were up to 10,000 North Korean troops fighting alongside the Russians in the Kursk uh region.</p>
<p>是的。一段时间以来，西方情报官员推测约有1万名朝鲜士兵在库尔斯克地区与俄军并肩作战。</p>

<h3>00:01:18,848</h3>
<p>Up until now, both Russia and North Korea have remained silent on this issue.</p>
<p>此前俄朝双方对此事一直保持沉默。</p>
<p>But today for the first time uh North Korea has come out and acknowledged that is the case.</p>
<p>但今天朝鲜首次公开承认这一事实。</p>
<p>Uh President Putin has thank them for their heroism and it's thought some uh a thousand North Korean troops have been killed during those operations which as you say the North Koreans and the Russians have called efforts to liberate the Kursk region from uh Ukraine.</p>
<p>普京总统感谢他们的“英勇”，据信约1000名朝鲜士兵在这些行动中丧生，朝俄双方称其为“从乌克兰解放库尔斯克地区”的行动。</p>

<h3>00:01:48,656</h3>
<p>Um, so nothing really that we didn't know was happening or suspect was happening, but interesting that they've chosen to acknowledge it at this moment.</p>
<p>这并未超出我们的已知或推测，但有趣的是他们选择此时承认。</p>
<p>And to the war more widely, we've heard quite a bit in recent days about a scenario in which Ukraine agrees to give up control of Crimea and acknowledge Russia owns Crimea as part of some kind of ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p>更广泛来看，近日有消息称乌克兰可能同意放弃克里米亚并承认俄方所有权，作为停火协议的一部分。</p>

<h3>00:02:14,856</h3>
<p>But what is Ukraine saying about that prospect?</p>
<p>但乌克兰对此有何回应？</p>
<p>Well, we've heard that from the Americans. That's what Donald Trump has suggested might happen.</p>
<p>这是美方的说法，即特朗普推测的可能性。</p>
<p>And under this American plan, which has been presented to both the Russians and the Ukrainians, uh, America would officially recognize Russian control over Crimea.</p>
<p>根据这份已提交俄乌双方的美国方案，美方将正式承认俄罗斯对克里米亚的控制权。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p><a name="block-8"></a></p>
<h3>00:02:35,890</h3>
<p>But we've certainly not heard the Ukrainians say that they're ready to accept that.</p>
<p>但乌方明确表示尚未准备接受。</p>
<p>In fact, President Zalinski has said that is something he is not able to do.</p>
<p>事实上，泽连斯基总统称他无权这样做。</p>
<p>it is against Russ uh the Ukrainian constitution.</p>
<p>这违反乌克兰宪法。</p>
<p>It might require a referendum.</p>
<p>可能需要全民公投。</p>
<p>He doesn't have the mandate to do that.</p>
<p>他未被授权决定此事。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p><a name="block-9"></a></p>
<h3>00:02:51,322</h3>
<p>And what the Ukrainian leader has said is that before there can be any discussions about territory, we have to have a ceasefire, a complete unconditional ceasefire, which is something the Americans were pushing for as well and something that Moscow has rejected.</p>
<p>乌方领导人表示，在讨论领土前必须先实现完全无条件的停火，这也是美方推动但莫斯科拒绝的。</p>
<p>So look, I do think that there is an acceptance amongst many Ukrainians that they will have to seed some territory to the Russians potentially on a sort of temporary basis, maybe with the final status of those territories to be negotiated further down the line.</p>
<p>我认为许多乌克兰人已接受可能需暂时让出部分领土，最终地位留待后续谈判。</p>

<h3>00:03:25,959</h3>
<p>But they've certainly not said that they're ready to just give up crime Crimea before we've even get to the ceasefire stage.</p>
<p>但他们明确表示不会在停火前就放弃克里米亚。</p>
<p>Where are we with ceasefire talks?</p>
<p>当前停火谈判进展如何？</p>
<p>Because on the weekend we we saw those incredible pictures of Presidents Trump and Zalinski sitting face to face uh at the Pope's funeral on the sidelines in those chairs.</p>
<p>因周末我们看到特朗普与泽连斯基在教皇葬礼间隙面对面坐着的画面。</p>

<p><a name="block-11"></a></p>
<h3>00:03:46,044</h3>
<p>Has that kind of ignited hopes that something might be achieved quite soon?</p>
<p>这是否燃起了短期内取得进展的希望？</p>
<p>Well, I think definitely that was a positive uh sign, especially for Ukrainians, that those amazing pictures of the two men, their heads together, chewing things over, a far cry from the slanging match that the uh two presidents had at the Oval Office back in February.</p>
<p>这无疑是积极信号，尤其是对乌方而言，二人低头磋商的画面与2月白宫争吵形成鲜明对比。</p>

<hr />
<p><a name="block-12"></a></p>
<h3>00:04:09,966</h3>
<p>But as to where we are with the talks, I mean, who knows?</p>
<p>但谈判实际进展仍不明朗。</p>
<p>Frankly, discussions are still ongoing, but President Trump seems to say a different thing every day.</p>
<p>坦率说讨论仍在继续，但特朗普总统每日表态不一。</p>
<p>You know, one minute he's praising Vladimir Putin and blaming everything on the Ukrainian leader, Vladimir Zalinski, saying he finds uh the Ukrainian leader more difficult to deal with than President Putin.</p>
<p>他时而赞扬普京并归咎于乌领导人泽连斯基，称后者比普京更难应对。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-13"></a></p>
<h3>00:04:31,629</h3>
<p>The next day, he's criticizing President Putin for continued civilian tax attacks uh attacks on civilians in Ukraine and saying that the Russian leader might just be tapping him along.</p>
<p>次日又批评普京持续袭击乌克兰平民，称俄领导人可能在敷衍他。</p>
<p>So it's very difficult to know where we are but certainly in the terms of their public statements you don't feel that a deal is in the offing.</p>
<p>因此难以判断进展，但从公开声明看协议尚难达成。</p>
