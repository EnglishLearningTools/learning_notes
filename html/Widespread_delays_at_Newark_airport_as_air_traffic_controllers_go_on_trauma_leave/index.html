<p>This all goes back to an inciden last Monday at the key radar facility, responsible for departing and approaching Newark</p>
<p>这一切源于上周一在负责纽瓦克起降的关键雷达设施发生的事件。</p>
<p>And a source familiar with that incident tells me that controllers there lost both radio communications and the picture on their radar s for an undisclosed time, meaning those controllers were essentially trying to do their jobs blind.</p>
<p>一位熟悉该事件的消息人士告诉我，那里的空管人员在某段时间内失去了无线电通信和雷达图像，意味着他们基本上是在“盲操作”。</p>

<p>It's actually made problems wors</p>
<p>实际上这让问题更糟。</p>
<p>Newark is really emblematic, though, of the air traffic contr staffing problems nationwide, and the Union of Air Traffic Controllers says they're still 3000 controll short nationwide.</p>
<p>纽瓦克是全国空管人员短缺的缩影，空管员工会表示全国仍短缺3000名空管人员。</p>

<p>上周五，美联航CEO斯科特·柯比向乘客发送备忘录，称空管人员“离岗”。</p>
<p>That union says it's unfair because controllers were traumat and they took this leave once again, something that they're legally allowed to do.</p>
<p>工会表示这不公平，因为空管人员受到创伤，他们只是行使合法休假权利。</p>
