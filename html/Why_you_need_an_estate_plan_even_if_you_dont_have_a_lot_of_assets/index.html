<h3>00:00:00,400</h3>
<p>According to Carring's 2025 wills and estate planning study, the number of Americans with a will is on the decline from 33% in 2022 to just 24% in 2025.</p>
<p>根据Carring 2025年遗嘱与遗产规划研究，拥有遗嘱的美国人数量从2022年的33%下降到2025年的仅24%。</p>
<p>When asked why, over 30% claim they don't have enough assets to pass down.</p>
<p>当被问及原因时，超过30%的人声称他们没有足够的资产可以传承。</p>

<h3>00:00:16,960</h3>
<p>But even if you're not a millionaire or billionaire, you don't want to be caught without a plan here.</p>
<p>但即使你不是百万富翁或亿万富翁，你也不希望在这方面毫无准备。</p>
<p>And here with some advice, we've got Lark Hound, who is the estate planning attorney attorney and founder of two-hour lifestyle lawyer and the author of the new playbook and book Lifestyle Lawyer Resolution.</p>
<p>我们请来了遗产规划律师、两小时生活方式律师创始人兼新书《生活方式律师解决方案》的作者Lark Hound提供建议。</p>

<h3>00:00:34,144</h3>
<p>Great to have you here in studio with us, Laura.</p>
<p>Laura，很高兴你能来到演播室。</p>
<p>We got to know what can the average American learn about estate planning from an individual, say like Warren Buffett.</p>
<p>我们想知道普通美国人能从像沃伦·巴菲特这样的人身上学到什么关于遗产规划的知识。</p>
<p>Yeah. So, Warren Buffett has recently updated his estate plan is my understanding.</p>
<p>是的。据我所知，沃伦·巴菲特最近更新了他的遗产计划。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-4"></a></p>
<h3>00:00:47,946</h3>
<p>And I think this is a really good way to illustrate to people um that estate planning is not something you just do once, right?</p>
<p>我认为这是一个很好的例子，向人们说明遗产规划不是一劳永逸的事情，对吧？</p>
<p>It's something you get in place hopefully when you're younger and you're just starting a family or you're buying your first home.</p>
<p>你最好在年轻时、刚组建家庭或购买第一套房子时就做好规划。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-5"></a></p>
<h3>00:01:00,640</h3>
<p>But then your life is going to change, the law is going to change, your assets are going to change.</p>
<p>但之后你的生活会变化，法律会变化，你的资产也会变化。</p>
<p>All of these things are going to change over time.</p>
<p>所有这些都会随着时间的推移而变化。</p>
<p>So do what Warren Buffett is doing, right? update it continuously.</p>
<p>所以像沃伦·巴菲特那样做，对吧？持续更新它。</p>
<p>I believe he's in his 90s and he's still tweaking.</p>
<p>我相信他已经90多岁了，但他仍在调整。</p>

<p><a name="block-6"></a></p>
<h3>00:01:15,680</h3>
<p>Yeah. And so with that in mind and some of the good things that we've been able to take away from how Warren Buffett is navigating his own estate planning, much larger at scale than many of us, but on the other side of that, you have some some horror stories unfortunately.</p>
<p>是的。考虑到这一点，以及我们从沃伦·巴菲特的遗产规划中学到的一些好的经验（尽管规模比我们大得多），但另一方面，不幸的是也有一些可怕的案例。</p>
<p>What are some of the mistakes we should classify them as that you see people make?</p>
<p>你看到人们犯的一些错误，我们应该如何分类？</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-7"></a></p>
<h3>00:01:34,611</h3>
<p>Yeah, some of the big mistakes that we see.</p>
<p>是的，我们看到的一些重大错误。</p>
<p>Number one, thinking you don't need an estate plan, right?</p>
<p>第一，认为你不需要遗产规划，对吧？</p>
<p>And this is the number one that we hear, the number one thing that we hear, I don't have enough money for an estate plan.</p>
<p>这是我们最常听到的，最常听到的一句话是：我没有足够的钱做遗产规划。</p>
<p>And the thing that I would love to get across is that, you know, estate planning really benefits everyone.</p>
<p>我想强调的是，遗产规划真的对每个人都有益。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-8"></a></p>
<h3>00:01:50,150</h3>
<p>Uh this is why I think people struggle to write the check because they don't understand, well, what am I getting?</p>
<p>这就是为什么我认为人们不愿意付钱，因为他们不明白自己能得到什么。</p>
<p>Um but it benefits everyone, whether you're nominating guardians for your children or you're saving on estate taxes or you're just ensuring that your family's um privacy is kept intact after you pass away.</p>
<p>但它对每个人都有益，无论是为子女指定监护人、节省遗产税，还是确保在你去世后家庭的隐私得到保护。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-9"></a></p>
<h3>00:02:06,410</h3>
<p>There's a lot of problems that estate planning solves and a lawyer can help with that.</p>
<p>遗产规划能解决很多问题，而律师可以提供帮助。</p>
<p>You actually recommend that people avoid AI generated or online wills.</p>
<p>你实际上建议人们避免使用AI生成或在线遗嘱。</p>
<p>Why why is that?</p>
<p>为什么？</p>
<p>I do recommend that they avoid it and I think there's a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>我确实建议避免，原因有很多。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-10"></a></p>
<h3>00:02:20,741</h3>
<p>Number one, it may not be um done properly, right?</p>
<p>第一，它可能没有正确完成，对吧？</p>
<p>We're looking at the outcome here.</p>
<p>我们关注的是结果。</p>
<p>We're not just looking at, well, does this document look legal and official?</p>
<p>我们不只是看这份文件是否看起来合法和正式。</p>
<p>Right? The legal language matters.</p>
<p>对吧？法律语言很重要。</p>
<p>Um how it's executed and signed matters or else the court's not going to accept it.</p>
<p>它的签署和执行方式也很重要，否则法院不会接受。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-11"></a></p>
<h3>00:02:36,440</h3>
<p>So, um, the legal language may not be what you want.</p>
<p>所以，法律语言可能不符合你的需求。</p>
<p>It may not be executed properly.</p>
<p>它可能没有正确执行。</p>
<p>And the last thing I'd like to say as well is that this is really something, um, it's a lifelong endeavor, right?</p>
<p>最后我想说的是，这真的是一项终身事业，对吧？</p>
<p>So, this is the kind of thing that you want to be forming a relationship with an attorney over your life.</p>
<p>所以，这是你希望在一生中与律师建立关系的事情。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-12"></a></p>
<h3>00:02:51,962</h3>
<p>Kind of like how you go to the dentist every year, you go to the doctor, you want to see your lawyer every year.</p>
<p>就像你每年去看牙医、看医生一样，你也应该每年见律师。</p>
<p>What's changed? Maybe it's just the laws that have changed.</p>
<p>有什么变化？可能只是法律变了。</p>
<p>Certainly, right? And if those have changed, you're going to need to get new documents, maybe.</p>
<p>当然，对吧？如果法律变了，你可能需要更新文件。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-13"></a></p>
<h3>00:03:03,613</h3>
<p>And so how have we seen different generations look across will generation differently and making sure that as one of our guests put it earlier this week when you step out of life that everything is ready to be passed on correctly.</p>
<p>我们如何看待不同世代对遗嘱的不同态度，并确保正如我们本周早些时候一位嘉宾所说，当你离开人世时，一切都已准备好正确传承。</p>
<p>What we're seeing is for a long time the will was the main document and that's what everyone's heard of.</p>
<p>我们看到长期以来遗嘱是主要文件，也是大家所熟知的。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-14"></a></p>
<h3>00:03:25,272</h3>
<p>I need to have a will.</p>
<p>我需要立遗嘱。</p>
<p>Um a will is great.</p>
<p>遗嘱很好。</p>
<p>It doesn't do everything.</p>
<p>但它并不能解决所有问题。</p>
<p>it doesn't solve a lot of the problems that people think I think are solved by a will.</p>
<p>它并不能解决许多人认为遗嘱能解决的问题。</p>
<p>So, a better idea might be a living trust.</p>
<p>所以，更好的选择可能是生前信托。</p>
<p>And this is just going to depend on you and your family and your assets.</p>
<p>这取决于你、你的家庭和资产。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-15"></a></p>
<h3>00:03:40,265</h3>
<p>Um, but a living trust solves all the same problems as a will while also avoiding probate courts.</p>
<p>但生前信托能解决遗嘱的所有问题，同时还能避免遗嘱认证法庭。</p>
<p>Um, maybe avoiding taxes.</p>
<p>或许还能避税。</p>
<p>There's some different things that you can do.</p>
<p>你可以采取一些不同的措施。</p>
