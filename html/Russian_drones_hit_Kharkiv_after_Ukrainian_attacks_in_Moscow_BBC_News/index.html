<h3>00:00:00,560</h3>
<p>Russia says Ukraine launched a wave of drones at Moscow for the second night in a row.</p>
<p>俄罗斯称乌克兰连续第二晚向莫斯科发动一波无人机袭击。</p>
<p>All four of Moscow's major airports were closed temporarily in what officials say was a safety precaution.</p>
<p>莫斯科四大主要机场暂时关闭，官员称这是安全预防措施。</p>
<p>There are no reports of any casualties.</p>
<p>目前没有人员伤亡报告。</p>
<p>Ukraine has not commented, but the mayor of HKE said Russian drones had attacked the city and the Kev region overnight.</p>
<p>乌克兰尚未置评，但HKE市长称俄罗斯无人机夜间袭击了该市和Kev地区。</p>

<h3>00:00:24,514</h3>
<p>Let's speak to Frank Gardner now in Kev.</p>
<p>现在让我们连线在Kev的弗兰克·加德纳。</p>
<p>Uh Frank, what can we understand about what we think Ukraine is trying to achieve with this?</p>
<p>呃，弗兰克，我们如何理解乌克兰试图通过这次袭击达到什么目的？</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>当然。</p>
<p>Well, I think it's worth reminding ourselves that as Britain and other countries are celebrating the victory in Europe day, the defeat of Nazi Germany at the end of the Second World War, there is still a fullscale war raging here in this part of Europe.</p>
<p>我认为值得提醒的是，尽管英国和其他国家正在庆祝欧洲胜利日，即二战结束时纳粹德国的战败，但欧洲这一地区仍有一场全面战争在肆虐。</p>

<h3>00:00:49,567</h3>
<p>And it's been kicking off uh overnight in both Moscow and on the border region.</p>
<p>而且昨晚在莫斯科和边境地区都爆发了冲突。</p>
<p>So although Ukraine hasn't publicly admitted to launching these drones, there's no question in any anybody's mind these were Ukrainian drones that have been launched and Moscow says that 105 drones were shot down, 19 of them over the Moscow region.</p>
<p>因此，尽管乌克兰尚未公开承认发动这些无人机袭击，但毫无疑问，这些是乌克兰发射的无人机，莫斯科称击落了105架无人机，其中19架在莫斯科地区上空。</p>

<h3>00:01:11,242</h3>
<p>And even though none of them actually killed or or uh wounded anybody, symbolically this is quite important.</p>
<p>尽管实际上没有造成人员伤亡，但象征意义相当重要。</p>
<p>It's embarrassing, I think, for President Putin, who is about to host and stage um the symbolically very important victory day, the so-called Dian Pabidia victory day uh at the end of the great patriotic war.</p>
<p>我认为这对普京总统来说很尴尬，他即将主持并举行象征意义重大的胜利日，即所谓的大卫国战争胜利日。</p>

<h3>00:01:32,897</h3>
<p>This is Friday, the big march pass through Red Square in Moscow.</p>
<p>本周五，盛大的阅兵式将在莫斯科红场举行。</p>
<p>He doesn't want anything to disrupt that.</p>
<p>他不希望任何事情干扰这一活动。</p>
<p>So, the fact that these drones are able to penetrate Moscow's air defenses is really, I think, will be rattling people in Russia.</p>
<p>因此，我认为这些无人机能够突破莫斯科的防空系统，确实会让俄罗斯人感到不安。</p>

<h3>00:01:47,622</h3>
<p>At the same time, the war goes on in the east of Ukraine on both sides of the border.</p>
<p>与此同时，战争在乌克兰东部和边境两侧持续。</p>
<p>You've got Russia saying it has managed to expel all the Ukrainian forces that it made their incursion into Russia in August last year.</p>
<p>俄罗斯称已成功驱逐去年8月入侵俄罗斯的所有乌克兰部队。</p>
<p>Ukraine says, "Nah, not true. We are still fighting and we're still carrying out combat operations there."</p>
<p>乌克兰表示：“不，这不是真的。我们仍在战斗，仍在进行作战行动。”</p>

<h3>00:02:07,438</h3>
<p>The same time, Russia has been launching glide bombs.</p>
<p>与此同时，俄罗斯一直在发射滑翔炸弹。</p>
<p>These are big crude bombs fitted with fins and GPS satellite uh guidance systems that glide towards their target often with up to a ton and a half of explosive in their warhead.</p>
<p>这些是装有尾翼和GPS卫星制导系统的大型简易炸弹，滑向目标时弹头通常携带多达1.5吨的炸药。</p>
<p>And these have been launched against the second city here in Ukraine of Kharkiv and there have been a number of casualties there.</p>
<p>这些炸弹已针对乌克兰第二大城市哈尔科夫发射，并造成多人伤亡。</p>

<h3>00:02:32,157</h3>
<p>And where does all this leave efforts for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine?</p>
<p>这一切对俄罗斯和乌克兰之间的停火努力有何影响？</p>
<p>Well, Ukraine signed up to a US proposal back on March the 11th for a 30-day ceasefire.</p>
<p>乌克兰于3月11日签署了美国提出的30天停火协议。</p>
<p>Ukraine had proposed a kind of temporary or a partial one.</p>
<p>乌克兰曾提出一种临时或部分停火。</p>
<p>They said, "Well, how about a ceasefire on on in the air and on the sea?"</p>
<p>他们说：“那么，在空中和海上停火如何？”</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-9"></a></p>
<h3>00:02:53,489</h3>
<p>And America said, "Hey, look, we can go further than that. How about we do a comprehensive one?" and Ukraine, which was at the time still absolutely reeling from that um dressing down that President Silinski got in the Oval Office from President Trump and his vice president JD Vance.</p>
<p>美国表示：“嘿，我们可以更进一步。我们进行全面停火如何？”而乌克兰当时仍因总统西林斯基在椭圆形办公室受到特朗普总统及其副总统JD·万斯的严厉批评而震惊。</p>
<p>Ukraine was very keen to appear compliant with any US demand said absolutely we'll sign up to that 30 days, no worries.</p>
<p>乌克兰非常希望表现出对美国要求的顺从，表示绝对会签署30天停火协议，没问题。</p>

<h3>00:03:16,082</h3>
<p>Russia didn't sign up to it and Ukraine is saying, "Well, we hope you're going to put some pressure on them."</p>
<p>俄罗斯没有签署，乌克兰表示：“我们希望你们能对他们施加一些压力。”</p>
<p>They didn't.</p>
<p>他们没有。</p>
<p>Instead, Russia has proposed this temporary three-day ceasefire over the period of the Victory Day celebrations.</p>
<p>相反，俄罗斯提议在胜利日庆祝期间临时停火三天。</p>
<p>And Ukraine is pretty cynical about that.</p>
<p>乌克兰对此相当怀疑。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-11"></a></p>
<h3>00:03:31,124</h3>
<p>They're saying, "Look, the Easter truce that President Putin proposed was broken very quickly.</p>
<p>他们说：“看，普京总统提出的复活节停火很快就被打破了。</p>
<p>Actually, both sides broke it.</p>
<p>实际上，双方都打破了停火。</p>
<p>There were hundreds, if not thousands of infractions of that truce.</p>
<p>那次停火有数百甚至数千次违规行为。</p>
<p>So, nobody here in Ukraine thinks that this truce is worth the paper it's written on.</p>
<p>因此，乌克兰没有人认为这次停火值得一纸空文。</p>

<p><a name="block-12"></a></p>
<h3>00:03:46,799</h3>
<p>Ukraine wants a full end to the war.</p>
<p>乌克兰希望战争完全结束。</p>
<p>So does Russia, but Russia wants it on its terms, which are unacceptable to Ukraine.</p>
<p>俄罗斯也希望如此，但俄罗斯希望按照自己的条件结束战争，这对乌克兰来说是不可接受的。</p>
<p>You mentioned there about the fighting being done by Ukrainian forces inside Russian borders that Russia denies.</p>
<p>你提到乌克兰部队在俄罗斯境内进行的战斗，俄罗斯否认这一点。</p>

<h3>00:04:02,800</h3>
<p>What do we know about what's really happening on the ground there?</p>
<p>我们对那里的实际情况了解多少？</p>
<p>Okay, so if you look at the map, the areas we're talking about, Emma, are absolutely tiny.</p>
<p>好的，如果你看地图，我们谈论的区域，艾玛，绝对很小。</p>
<p>I mean, you would need to zoom right in to go right up with almost with a magnifying glass to see the area that Ukraine is operating in.</p>
<p>我的意思是，你需要放大到几乎用放大镜才能看到乌克兰正在活动的区域。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-14"></a></p>
<h3>00:04:25,360</h3>
<p>It's right on the border.</p>
<p>它就在边境上。</p>
<p>Even when they made their incursion in in August and were able to seize about a thousand square kilometers of land, it's still minuscule compared to the 20% roughly of Ukraine that Russia is now occupying, but it's symbolic.</p>
<p>即使他们在8月入侵并占领了约1000平方公里的土地，与俄罗斯目前占领的乌克兰约20%的领土相比，这仍然微不足道，但具有象征意义。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-15"></a></p>
<h3>00:04:42,098</h3>
<p>So Ukraine was hoping to by this to use it as a bargaining chip to say to Russia, well look, we'll pull out of the areas we've taken if you pull out of some, if not all of the areas you've taken.</p>
<p>因此，乌克兰希望通过此举将其作为谈判筹码，对俄罗斯说，看，如果你们撤出部分甚至全部占领的地区，我们也会撤出我们占领的地区。</p>
<p>That hasn't really worked.</p>
<p>这并没有真正奏效。</p>
<p>Um they're also hoping to create a buffer zone.</p>
<p>呃，他们还希望建立一个缓冲区。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-16"></a></p>
<h3>00:04:57,072</h3>
<p>Again, that's not really worked.</p>
<p>同样，这也没有真正奏效。</p>
<p>So, what's going on there at the moment is that Ukraine is launching some limited strikes using drones um and artillery onto things like um Russia's command post just inside the border.</p>
<p>因此，目前的情况是，乌克兰正在使用无人机和火炮对边境附近的俄罗斯指挥所等目标发动一些有限打击。</p>
<p>Um command posts that are launching drone strikes against Ukraine.</p>
<p>呃，这些指挥所正在对乌克兰发动无人机袭击。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p><a name="block-17"></a></p>
<h3>00:05:15,885</h3>
<p>They've been hitting them.</p>
<p>他们一直在打击这些目标。</p>
<p>They also did some mine clearing in the last 24 hours where they were able to drive a path reportedly through a mine a Russian minefield and then get armored vehicles and infantry into just inside Russia.</p>
<p>过去24小时内，他们还进行了一些扫雷行动，据报道，他们能够穿过俄罗斯雷区开辟一条道路，然后将装甲车和步兵送入俄罗斯境内。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-18"></a></p>
<h3>00:05:30,932</h3>
<p>So we're talking here about the Kursk and Belgod oblas provinces just inside Russia.</p>
<p>因此，我们谈论的是俄罗斯境内的库尔斯克和别尔哥罗德州。</p>
<p>Enough to annoy President Putin, not enough to change the course of this war.</p>
<p>足以激怒普京总统，但不足以改变这场战争的进程。</p>
<p>Frank Gardner, great to talk to you.</p>
<p>弗兰克·加德纳，很高兴与你交谈。</p>
