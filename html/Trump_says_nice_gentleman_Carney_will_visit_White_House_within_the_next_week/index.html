<h3>00:02:07,135</h3>

<p>"确实如此"。</p>
<p>From the prime minister's office, of course, because we have heard from Mark Carney saying that it would happen, but it needs to happen in a spirit of respect.</p>

<p>"那么他对两位领导人具体持何看法？"</p>
<p>Yeah, that's right.</p>
<p>"没错"。</p>
<p>Uh this is the second time uh that we've heard Donald Trump say that uh that that Mark Carney is a really nice guy and uh and and uh uh in a way shower him with uh with with very nice things more so than we've heard Donald Trump say about other people other leaders who have visited the White House and who he's spoken to.</p>

<h3>00:02:47,280</h3>
<p>So that was a little bit of a surprise.</p>
<p>"这有些令人意外"。</p>
<p>Perhaps before the election the the thought was that maybe he was saying those things uh in order to help Pierre Polev but uh now it's not so clear and in fact it's a little bit surprising that uh that for some reason Donald Trump thinks that Pv actually hates him more in the words of Trump.</p>
<p>"选前可能认为他是在帮帕列夫造势，但现在看来并非如此——更令人惊讶的是特朗普认为帕列夫更讨厌他"。</p>

<p><a name="block-11"></a></p>
<h3>00:03:11,144</h3>
<p>um surprising I say because uh there's no suggestion.</p>
<p>"之所以惊讶是因为毫无迹象表明"。</p>
<p>We're not aware that the two men have ever met or even spoken to one another.</p>
<p>"据我们所知两人从未谋面甚至交谈"。</p>
<p>So he's obviously uh uh taking this impression from uh from what he's seeing or what he is hearing uh from the campaign itself.</p>
<p>"显然他的这种印象来自竞选期间的所见所闻"。</p>

<hr />
<p><a name="block-12"></a></p>
<h3>00:03:28,135</h3>
<p>But uh either way, he seems to think that uh that Carney is someone that he can do business with.</p>
<p>"但无论如何，他似乎认为卡尼是可以合作的对象"。</p>
<p>Uh he said that before, now he's saying it after the election.</p>
<p>"他选前就这么说，现在选举后再次强调"。</p>
<p>So, we'll see where that is going to end up and and whether in fact it uh it will lead to some kind of a breakthrough when the two men actually meet face to face.</p>
<p>"有待观察两人实际会面时能否取得突破"。</p>
