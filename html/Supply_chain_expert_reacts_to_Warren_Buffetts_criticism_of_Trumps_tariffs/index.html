<h1>Supply chain expert reacts to Warren Buffett's criticism of Trump's tariffs</h1>
<p>【新一轮关税预计将对汽车行业产生重大影响。从今天开始，几乎所有进口汽车零部件都将征收25%的进口税。这项征税并不能保护美国制造的汽车。去年美国工厂生产的1000万辆汽车中，没有一辆是完全不使用进口零部件的。虽然消费者可能不会立即看到价格上涨，但专家估计，关税最终可能使车辆成本增加约4000美元。】</p>
<p>Summary:
A new round of tariffs is expected to have a major impact on the auto industry.</p>

<h3>00:00:04,471</h3>
<p>And starting today, nearly all imported auto parts will come with a 25% import tax.</p>
<p>从今天开始，几乎所有进口汽车零部件都将征收25%的进口税。</p>
<p>And that levy does not protect cars made in America.</p>
<p>这项征税并不能保护美国制造的汽车。</p>
<p>Not one of the 10 million cars to come out of U.S. plants last year was built without at least some imported parts.</p>
<p>去年美国工厂生产的1000万辆汽车中，没有一辆是完全不使用进口零部件的。</p>

<p>And while consumers may not see any price hikes right away, experts estimate the tariff could ultimately add about $4,000 to the cost of vehicle.</p>
<p>虽然消费者可能不会立即看到价格上涨，但专家估计，关税最终可能使车辆成本增加约4000美元。</p>

<p>正如你所说，杰西卡，对于整车来说，如果你购买新车，可能不会立即感受到影响。</p>
<p>But if you need a repair in any of the parts for your car in the next few weeks, you might be able to notice a little jump on the prices already.</p>
<p>但如果你在未来几周需要修理汽车的某些零部件，可能已经会注意到价格的小幅上涨。</p>

<h3>00:00:54,987</h3>
<p>But we're also hitting another milestone this week.</p>
<p>不过本周我们还迎来了另一个重要节点。</p>
<p>You know, those tariffs that went into place on April 9th for all of the ships that were leaving China?</p>
<p>你知道那些4月9日对中国出发的所有船只实施的关税吗？</p>
<p>All of those ships have already arrived here, and now we're seeing the first wave of merchandise that's arriving from China that is subject to that 145% tariff.</p>
<p>所有这些船只已经抵达这里，现在我们正看到第一批来自中国的商品抵达，这些商品需缴纳145%的关税。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-5"></a></p>
<h3>00:01:14,974</h3>
<p>And that is already having an impact in the Port of Los Angeles, the largest port in the United States.</p>
<p>这已经对美国最大的港口洛杉矶港产生了影响。</p>
<p>A lot of merchandise from China comes in through right here.</p>
<p>大量来自中国的商品正是通过这里进入的。</p>
<p>And we spoke with the director, the executive director of the port, John Scirocco, who said they're already seeing a drop in arrivals for the next week.</p>
<p>我们与港口执行董事约翰·西罗科交谈过，他表示他们已经看到下周到港货物量的下降。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-6"></a></p>
<h3>00:01:34,593</h3>
<p>So we are already seeing an impact.</p>
<p>所以我们已经在看到影响了。</p>
<p>The importers are saying we're going to wait and see what happens with these tariffs first, and then we'll make decisions as to what to do.</p>
<p>进口商表示他们会先观望这些关税的影响，然后再决定如何应对。</p>
<p>But in the meantime, what do you do if you have merchandise that's arriving?</p>
<p>但与此同时，如果你的商品已经到港该怎么办？</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-7"></a></p>
<h3>00:01:49,238</h3>
<p>You already paid.</p>
<p>你已经付款了。</p>
<p>Now you have to pay the tariff.</p>
<p>现在你还得支付关税。</p>
<p>Well one way that business owners are going around this is looking at bonded warehouses.</p>
<p>企业主们解决这个问题的一种方法是考虑使用保税仓库。</p>
<p>These are spaces that are completely legal in the U.S.</p>
<p>这些仓库在美国是完全合法的。</p>
<p>And they're really close to ports like this one where you can store your merchandise for up to five years and you don't have to pay taxes or tariffs on it until you take the merchandise out, presumably when you've already made a sale.</p>
<p>它们离港口很近，比如这个港口，你可以在这里存放商品长达五年，直到你把商品取出时才需要缴纳税费或关税，通常是在你已经完成销售之后。</p>

<h3>00:02:15,200</h3>
<p>We actually caught up with one of the business owners who runs one of these places.</p>
<p>我们实际上采访了一位经营这种仓库的企业主。</p>
<p>Take a listen to what she said.</p>
<p>听听她是怎么说的。</p>
<p>This is the first big shipment, one of two containers, 40ft containers that came in from China that we're offloading, and we're going to put it on that side of our warehouse, the bonded side.</p>
<p>这是第一批大货，两个40英尺集装箱中的一个，从中国运来的，我们正在卸货，准备放在仓库的保税区那边。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-9"></a></p>
<h3>00:02:37,101</h3>
<p>And so we can't go in that side.</p>
<p>所以我们不能进入那边。</p>
<p>This part is called a tax paid area.</p>
<p>这部分叫做完税区。</p>
<p>So all this product is subject to taxes and duties.</p>
<p>所以所有这些产品都需要缴纳税费。</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>So right now they're just offloading that product.</p>
<p>所以现在他们只是在卸货。</p>
<p>They're going to put it all on pallets.</p>
<p>他们会把所有货物放在托盘上。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-10"></a></p>
<h3>00:02:50,937</h3>
<p>So it comes in on just in boxes on the floor of the container.</p>
<p>货物是以箱子形式装在集装箱底部的。</p>
<p>They put it on pallets.</p>
<p>他们把货物放在托盘上。</p>
<p>Take it back.</p>
<p>运回去。</p>
<p>They're going to stack those pallets as high as we can get them.</p>
<p>他们会把托盘堆得尽可能高。</p>
<p>And then we wait for our instructions.</p>
<p>然后我们等待指示。</p>
<p>And Jessica, that merchandise that you're looking at, it's all sorts of things.</p>
<p>杰西卡，你看到的那些商品，种类繁多。</p>

<h3>00:03:08,520</h3>
<p>It's all things from parts that are going to be assembled and made in America to stationery, utensils, spatulas, strollers, all sorts of things.</p>
<p>从将在美国组装制造的零部件到文具、餐具、铲子、婴儿车，应有尽有。</p>
<p>Now, not going to be going to shelves right?</p>
<p>现在，这些商品不会马上上架，对吧？</p>
<p>So that could cause all sorts of other troubles as these business owners are kind of taking a gamble, right?</p>
<p>所以这可能会带来各种其他问题，因为这些企业主们某种程度上是在赌博，对吧？</p>

<h3>00:03:28,741</h3>
<p>They're saying we hope that talks with China will go well and therefore tariffs will go down by the time that we find buyers for our merchandise and have to pay that tax on it.</p>
<p>他们说希望与中国谈判顺利，这样等我们找到买家并需要缴纳税费时，关税已经降低了。</p>
<p>We shall see.</p>
<p>我们拭目以待。</p>

<p>Famed investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett, sharing his most direct thoughts on the tariffs for the first time today.</p>
<p>著名投资者、伯克希尔哈撒韦公司首席执行官沃伦·巴菲特今天首次就关税问题发表了他最直接的看法。</p>
<p>Speaking this morning at his company's shareholder meeting, the Oracle of Omaha called tariffs and trade wars a big mistake.</p>

<h3>00:03:58,805</h3>
<p>There is no question that trade can be an act of war.</p>
<p>毫无疑问，贸易可以是一种战争行为。</p>
<p>And I think it's led to bad things, just the attitudes it's brought out.</p>
<p>我认为它导致了不好的事情，就是它引发的态度。</p>
<p>I mean, we should be looking to work with the rest of the world, and we should do what we do best and they should do what they do best.</p>
<p>我的意思是，我们应该寻求与世界其他国家合作，我们应该做我们最擅长的事，他们也应该做他们最擅长的事。</p>

<p>Jack, thanks so much for being with us.</p>
<p>杰克，非常感谢你加入我们。</p>
<p>First, I do want to get your thoughts on what Warren Buffett had to say.</p>
<p>首先，我想听听你对沃伦·巴菲特所说的话的看法。</p>
<p>We also learned that the 94-year-old will be stepping down as the head of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year.</p>
<p>我们还了解到，这位94岁的老人将在年底卸任伯克希尔哈撒韦公司的掌门人职位。</p>

<h3>00:04:45,617</h3>
<p>So just first to get your reaction about his comments and also this news that he will be retiring.</p>
<p>所以首先想听听你对他评论的反应，以及他将退休的消息。</p>
<p>Thanks, Jessica.</p>
<p>谢谢，杰西卡。</p>
<p>Well, obviously Warren Buffett is a legend.</p>
<p>显然，沃伦·巴菲特是个传奇人物。</p>
<p>And I absolutely agree with his points on tariffs.</p>
<p>我完全同意他关于关税的观点。</p>
<p>I think they're destructive and they create market volatility.</p>
<p>我认为关税具有破坏性，会造成市场波动。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-17"></a></p>
<h3>00:05:04,603</h3>
<p>And one thing that I think was fantastic about Warren Buffett is his focus on value.</p>
<p>我认为沃伦·巴菲特很棒的一点是他对价值的关注。</p>
<p>Focus on value within companies and economies.</p>
<p>关注公司和经济中的价值。</p>
<p>We also both agree that manufacturing is the segment that has the most value.</p>
<p>我们还都认为制造业是最有价值的领域。</p>
<p>So for every dollar of manufacturing activity, there's a $2.70 return back to that economy.</p>
<p>因此，制造业每投入1美元，就能为经济带来2.7美元的回报。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-18"></a></p>
<h3>00:05:24,218</h3>
<p>So I think Warren Buffett and I would agree that we need to have a more robust manufacturing economy.</p>
<p>所以我认为沃伦·巴菲特和我都会同意我们需要一个更强大的制造业经济。</p>
<p>Not sure if tariffs are the way to get there.</p>
<p>不确定关税是否是实现这一目标的途径。</p>
<p>And listen, you're an expert in the supply chain.</p>
<p>听着，你是供应链方面的专家。</p>
<p>I think Americans got really familiar with all of that during Covid, and how disruptions can cause major problems in that, and disruptions in the supply chain.</p>
<p>我认为美国人在新冠疫情期间对供应链非常熟悉，知道中断会如何导致重大问题。</p>

<h3>00:05:45,278</h3>
<p>Set the scene for us about what we're about to experience.</p>
<p>为我们描述一下我们将要经历的情况。</p>
<p>But we were just talking to our Julia, who's there at the Port of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>我们刚刚和正在洛杉矶港的朱莉娅交谈过。</p>
<p>Set the scene for us.</p>
<p>为我们描述一下情况。</p>
<p>What is the supply chain about to look like?</p>
<p>供应链将会是什么样子？</p>
<p>How is that going to affect people out there watching?</p>
<p>这将如何影响观看的观众？</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-20"></a></p>
<h3>00:05:58,591</h3>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>So a blank sailing is when an ocean cargo ship makes an appointment for a voyage and then cancels that.</p>
<p>港口提到的一件事是集装箱到港量的下降。</p>
<p>Last week, blank sailings were at 4%.</p>
<p>供应链中有一种叫做"空白航行"的现象。</p>
<p>These are record levels of blank sailings.</p>
<p>"空白航行"是指远洋货轮预约了航程然后又取消。</p>
<p>They're even higher than the blank sailings were at the beginning of the Covid pandemic.</p>
<p>两周前，空白航行率为6%。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-21"></a></p>
<h3>00:06:29,956</h3>
<p>So we're about to see major disruptions at retail and consumers should expect to see some supply outages.</p>
<p>上周，空白航行率为4%。</p>
<p>They should see some price increases.</p>
<p>这些都是创纪录的空白航行水平。</p>
<p>I think the areas that will probably be most affected for consumers is consumer electronics, furniture and apparel.</p>
<p>甚至比新冠疫情初期的空白航行率还要高。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-22"></a></p>
<h3>00:06:49,608</h3>
<p>And so people should expect that to happen soon, next week, in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>所以我们即将看到零售业出现重大中断，消费者应该预期会出现一些供应短缺。</p>
<p>These retailers built up inventory in 2025 expecting that this was going to happen.</p>
<p>他们会看到一些价格上涨。</p>
<p>Now, the problem, of course, with building up inventory is that that costs money.</p>
<p>我认为对消费者影响最大的领域可能是消费电子产品、家具和服装。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-23"></a></p>
<h3>00:07:05,690</h3>
<p>And, you know, supply chains are long tail.</p>
<p>所以人们应该预期这很快就会发生，下周，未来几周内。</p>
<p>So there's a limit on how much inventory you can build up.</p>
<p>这些零售商在2025年建立了库存，预期这种情况会发生。</p>
<p>So I think there's, you know, some of the big retailers are going to try to manage that.</p>
<p>当然，建立库存的问题是这需要资金。</p>
<p>I think the small retailers are going to struggle the most.</p>
<p>而且，你知道，供应链是长尾的。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-24"></a></p>
<h3>00:07:18,571</h3>
<p>So yeah, there's just going to be a lot of disruption we'll just have to see what's going to happen.</p>
<p>所以你能建立的库存是有限度的。</p>
<p>But, you know, with these blank sailings and, you know, blank sailings are a sign that manufacturers in Asia are not producing.</p>
<p>所以我认为一些大型零售商会尝试管理这一点。</p>
<p>So they're not loading containers and containers aren't coming back to the United States.</p>
<p>我认为小型零售商将最为艰难。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p><a name="block-25"></a></p>
<h3>00:07:37,255</h3>
<p>President Trump has said that his tariffs are part of what he calls his plan to bring a new golden age to the American economy.</p>
<p>所以是的，将会有很多中断，我们只能看看会发生什么。</p>
<p>And he's acknowledged that there's going to be short-term pain.</p>
<p>但是，你知道，这些空白航行，空白航行是亚洲制造商没有生产的迹象。</p>
<p>And he says it will be worth it.</p>
<p>所以他们不装载集装箱，集装箱也不返回美国。</p>

<h3>00:07:49,502</h3>
<p>This is what he told NBC's Meet the Press.</p>
<p>特朗普总统表示，他的关税是他所谓的为美国经济带来新黄金时代计划的一部分。</p>
<p>Are you comfortable with the country potentially dipping into a recession for a period of time?</p>
<p>他承认短期内会有痛苦。</p>
<p>If you are able to achieve your goals?</p>
<p>他说这是值得的。</p>
<p>Well, you know, you say some people on Wall Street say, well, I tell you something.</p>

<p>你对国家可能陷入一段时间的衰退感到安心吗？</p>
<p>Is it okay in the short term to have a recession?</p>
<p>如果你能实现你的目标？</p>
<p>Look, yeah, it's everything's okay.</p>
<p>你知道，你说华尔街有些人说，我告诉你一些事。</p>

<p>Well, if we look at what happened with the first Trump administration when they put in place tariffs, they were limited and they were targeted.</p>
<p>短期内出现衰退可以吗？</p>
<p>And supply chains found ways around it through transshipment and other ways of doing things.</p>
<p>看，是的，一切都好。</p>
<p>These tariffs were much more broad sweeping.</p>
<p>在这一点上，你认为经济衰退的可能性在增加吗？</p>

<p>And there's fewer loopholes to get around.</p>
<p>如果我们看看特朗普第一届政府实施关税时发生了什么，那些关税是有限的和有针对性的。</p>
<p>So I think there is going to be supply chain disruption, of course.</p>
<p>供应链通过转运和其他方式找到了规避的方法。</p>
<p>If there's a strategy to do more assembling and production in the United States, that's a good thing.</p>
<p>这些关税的范围要广泛得多。</p>
<p>These things don't happen overnight.</p>
<p>而且规避的漏洞更少。</p>

<p>So I think there is, you know, a pretty significant risk of the economy going into some sort of decline.</p>
<p>所以我认为当然会出现供应链中断。</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>如果有在美国进行更多组装和生产的战略，那是件好事。</p>
<p>On that note, Jack Buffington, thanks so much for your time.</p>
<p>这些事情不会一夜之间发生。</p>
<p>We appreciate it.</p>
<p>所以我认为经济出现某种下滑的风险相当大。</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>好的。</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>说到这里，杰克·巴芬顿，非常感谢你的时间。</p>
