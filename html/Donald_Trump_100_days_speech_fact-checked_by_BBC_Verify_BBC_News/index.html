<h3>00:00:00,480</h3>
<p>President Trump has told supporters that his administration's achievements amounted to a revolution of common sense as he celebrated his first 100 days in office.</p>
<p>特朗普总统在庆祝执政百日时告诉支持者，其政府的成就堪称一场“常识革命”。</p>
<p>Speaking of Michigan, Mr. Trump insisted his tariff policies were a success, declaring to the crowd, "You ain't seen nothing yet."</p>
<p>谈到密歇根州，特朗普坚称他的关税政策取得了成功，并向人群宣布：“你们还没看到真正的成果。”</p>

<h3>00:00:18,155</h3>
<p>However, his approval ratings at 100 days are at the lowest level for any president for nearly 70 years.</p>
<p>然而，他的百日支持率是近70年来所有总统中最低的。</p>
<p>Donald Trump also attacked the legacy of his predecessor, Joe Biden, while claiming no other president had achieved more during their first few months in office.</p>
<p>特朗普还抨击了前任总统拜登的政绩，同时声称没有其他总统在执政头几个月取得过更多成就。</p>

<h3>00:00:33,321</h3>
<p>That is something we will be fact-checking in just a moment.</p>
<p>我们稍后将对此进行事实核查。</p>
<p>But first, let's have a listen to Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>但首先，让我们听听特朗普的讲话。</p>
<p>We're here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country.</p>
<p>今晚我们来到国家中心地带，庆祝我国历史上任何政府最成功的执政百日。</p>

<hr />
<p><a name="block-4"></a></p>
<h3>00:00:50,223</h3>
<p>And that's according to many, many people.</p>
<p>这是许多人公认的。</p>
<p>So that statement clearly is a matter of opinion.</p>
<p>显然，这一说法属于主观观点。</p>
<p>Mr. Trump went on to make a number of other very specific claims regarding his achievements in office ranging from inflation to immigration.</p>
<p>特朗普接着就其在通胀和移民等领域的政绩提出了一系列具体主张。</p>
<p>BBC verifies Jake Horton has been fact-checking Trump's 100-day speech.</p>
<p>BBC核查员杰克·霍顿一直在核实特朗普的百日演讲。</p>

<p><a name="block-5"></a></p>
<h3>00:01:08,642</h3>
<p>A lot of you have been reading his article on the BBC news website.</p>
<p>许多人一直在BBC新闻网站上阅读他的文章。</p>
<p>Jake, let's start firstly with the price of petrol which was something that was mentioned by Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>杰克，我们先从特朗普提到的汽油价格开始。</p>
<p>So tackling inflation was a key issue in the campaign and it's a key issue for the administration in their first 100 days and on specifically on the price of gasoline in the US.</p>
<p>解决通胀是竞选中的关键议题，也是政府执政百日的重点，尤其是美国的汽油价格。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p><a name="block-6"></a></p>
<h3>00:01:26,230</h3>
<p>So petrol, President Trump said this last night.</p>
<p>关于汽油，特朗普总统昨晚是这样说的。</p>
<p>So gasoline prices are down by a lot.</p>
<p>汽油价格大幅下降。</p>
<p>We just hit 198 in a lot of states.</p>
<p>许多州的油价已降至1.98美元。</p>
<p>Think of it.</p>
<p>想想看。</p>
<p>So both of those things are not accurate.</p>
<p>这两点都不准确。</p>
<p>So, the price of gasoline from the day that Trump entered office to this week has actually ticked up slightly.</p>
<p>事实上，从特朗普就职到本周，汽油价格略有上涨。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-7"></a></p>
<h3>00:01:48,910</h3>
<p>According to the American Automobile Association, which tracks this sort of thing.</p>
<p>根据追踪此类数据的美国汽车协会统计。</p>
<p>On the 20th of January, the day that Trump entered office, the average gas price, regular gas price in the US, was $3.13, around about that.</p>
<p>1月20日特朗普就职当天，美国普通汽油平均价格约为3.13美元。</p>
<p>And this week, it stands at $3.16.</p>
<p>而本周价格为3.16美元。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-8"></a></p>
<h3>00:02:06,377</h3>
<p>So, not up massively, ticked up slightly, but certainly not way down, as Trump said in that clip.</p>
<p>涨幅不大，略有上升，但绝不像特朗普在讲话中说的那样大幅下降。</p>
<p>And he also made a very specific claim about gas prices in certain states.</p>
<p>他还特别提到某些州的汽油价格。</p>
<p>And he said they are they're down to $1.98 in a lot of states.</p>
<p>他说许多州的油价已降至1.98美元。</p>
<p>And the same association which tracks gas prices across the US also breaks it down state by state.</p>
<p>同一家追踪全美油价的协会也提供了各州数据。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-9"></a></p>
<h3>00:02:25,635</h3>
<p>And there's no evidence that any state has an average gas price that low.</p>
<p>没有证据表明任何州的平均油价如此之低。</p>
<p>The lowest state is Mississippi.</p>
<p>油价最低的州是密西西比州。</p>
<p>In Mississippi, the average gas price at the moment this week is $2.67.</p>
<p>本周密西西比州的平均油价为2.67美元。</p>
<p>So a fair bit off that $1.98 that Trump quoted in his rally last night.</p>
<p>与特朗普昨晚集会中提到的1.98美元相差甚远。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p><a name="block-10"></a></p>
<h3>00:02:39,759</h3>
<p>What about immigration?</p>
<p>移民方面呢？</p>
<p>On immigration.</p>
<p>关于移民。</p>
<p>Obviously, another major campaign issue and an issue for the administration.</p>
<p>这显然是竞选和政府的另一重大议题。</p>
<p>And on his record on immigration in his first three months in office, President Trump said this last night.</p>
<p>关于执政头三个月的移民政策记录，特朗普总统昨晚这样说。</p>
<p>We've set all-time records for the lowest number of illegal border crossings ever recorded.</p>
<p>我们创下了有记录以来非法越境人数的最低纪录。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-11"></a></p>
<h3>00:02:57,734</h3>
<p>Think of that.</p>
<p>想想看。</p>
<p>Ever recorded.</p>
<p>有史以来最低。</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>这是真的吗？</p>
<p>Now, that is backed up by US Border Patrol statistics.</p>
<p>美国边境巡逻队的统计数据支持这一说法。</p>
<p>So last month in March as well as in February, the first two full months Trump was in office, immigration numbers have reached record lows.</p>
<p>特朗普执政后的前两个完整月份——2月和3月，移民数量创历史新低。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-12"></a></p>
<h3>00:03:13,528</h3>
<p>We have a graphic we can show you of that.</p>
<p>我们有相关图表可以展示。</p>
<p>That's actually a graphic to do with Doge, but we do have an immigration chart which shows the level of immigration in March.</p>
<p>这其实是关于Doge的图表，但我们确实有显示三月移民水平的图表。</p>
<p>The amount of encounters crossing the US border hit 7,000, just over 7,000 migrants crossed the US border and were encountered by Border Patrol.</p>
<p>越境遭遇数为7000人，略超7000名移民越境并被边境巡逻队拦截。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-13"></a></p>
<h3>00:03:31,564</h3>
<p>So that is the lowest on record since monthly records began in 2000.</p>
<p>这是自2000年有月度记录以来的最低值。</p>
<p>Compared to the Biden administration for context, the monthly totals in March last year were around 140,000.</p>
<p>作为对比，去年3月拜登政府时期的月度总数约为14万。</p>
<p>So a significant drop.</p>
<p>可见显著下降。</p>
<p>Trump said it was the lowest ever.</p>
<p>特朗普称这是有史以来最低。</p>
<p>Migration policy think tanks which track these sort of things say that it certainly is the lowest since records began on monthly data.</p>
<p>追踪此类数据的移民政策智库表示，这确实是有月度记录以来的最低值。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-14"></a></p>
<h3>00:03:56,959</h3>
<p>They do say if you look back to the 1960s the average monthly totals were lower but it certainly is a significant drop in recent times that Trump administration's overseas.</p>
<p>他们指出，1960年代的平均月度总数更低，但特朗普政府时期的数据确实是近年来的显著下降。</p>
<p>You mentioned there Jack Doge the department of government efficiency very controversial and the connection to Elon Musk of course let's have a listen to what President Trump had to say about that they've saved $150 billion on waste fraud and abuse doge $150 billion of savings.</p>
<p>你提到的政府效率部门Doge颇具争议，当然还有与埃隆·马斯克的关联。让我们听听特朗普总统对此的说法：他们通过Doge节省了1500亿美元的浪费、欺诈和滥用开支。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-15"></a></p>
<h3>00:04:24,465</h3>
<p>So this is the government initiative by Elon Musk which aims to dramatically cut US government spending.</p>
<p>这是埃隆·马斯克提出的政府倡议，旨在大幅削减美国政府支出。</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, Musk initially said it would cut $2 trillion from the US federal government budget.</p>
<p>竞选期间，马斯克最初表示将从美国联邦政府预算中削减2万亿美元。</p>
<p>He later revised this down to1 trillion.</p>
<p>后来他将其修正为1万亿美元。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-16"></a></p>
<h3>00:04:37,600</h3>
<p>And Doge's website at the moment said they've cut so far about $160 billion from the federal government budget.</p>
<p>而Doge网站目前称，他们已从联邦政府预算中削减约1600亿美元。</p>
<p>Now that is around about the ballpark that President Trump quoted in his clip there.</p>
<p>这与特朗普在讲话中提到的数字大致相符。</p>
<p>But it's important to say that a lot of these savings according to BBC Verifi's analysis are not actually backed up by any solid evidence.</p>
<p>但需要指出的是，BBC核查发现这些节省金额大多缺乏确凿证据支持。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-17"></a></p>
<h3>00:04:56,341</h3>
<p>So as you can see in this graphic out of that $160 billion total which is on DOJ's website only about $60 billion dollars of that are broken down by individual savings and only about half of that total has a receipt attached as proof.</p>
<p>如图所示，司法部网站上列出的1600亿美元总额中，仅约600亿有具体节省项目明细，其中又只有约半数附有收据作为证明。</p>
<p>So they say $160 billion, but it's very hard to independently verify that without any solid proof for a lot of those claim savings.</p>
<p>因此，虽然声称节省1600亿，但由于缺乏实质证据，很难独立核实大部分节省金额。</p>
