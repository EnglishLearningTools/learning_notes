<h3>00:00:00,160</h3>
<p>Still on the subject of political violence, Tesla has seen its share of hate, of course, since Elon Musk joined up with Donald Trump.</p>
<p>仍在讨论政治暴力的话题上，特斯拉当然也遭遇了仇恨，因为埃隆·马斯克与唐纳德·特朗普联手。</p>
<p>Fanatics like Owen McIntyre have been arrested for firebombing a Tesla dealership.</p>
<p>欧文·麦金太尔等狂热分子因纵火袭击特斯拉经销商而被捕。</p>
<p>But now that person has been let out of custody awaiting trial in order to get this, allow sex change treatments to continue.</p>
<p>但现在此人已被释放候审，以便继续接受变性治疗。</p>

<h3>00:00:21,760</h3>
<p>For his part, Musk says these types of threats are nothing new.</p>
<p>马斯克表示，这类威胁对他来说并不新鲜。</p>
<p>Do you guys feel like you're putting yourself at risk by doing this because you're stirring up so much hostility by these people ripping us off?</p>
<p>你们是否觉得这样做是在冒险，因为你们激起了这些人的敌意，他们在欺骗我们？</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>百分之百。</p>
<p>Well, we don't need to speculate about that.</p>
<p>我们不需要对此进行猜测。</p>

<h3>00:00:40,479</h3>
<p>Um, you can see online in in the protests that uh they make that very clear.</p>
<p>嗯，你可以在网上的抗议活动中看到，他们表达得非常清楚。</p>
<p>Um, I mean, I've been hanged in effigy many times.</p>
<p>我是说，我的肖像被多次吊起来焚烧。</p>
<p>Um and um there have been people that have actively advocated at these violent protests, violent protests uh for my death uh and have also advocated for the death of the the people at Doge.</p>
<p>嗯，还有人曾在这些暴力抗议活动中公开呼吁我的死亡，以及狗狗币相关人士的死亡。</p>

<h3>00:01:06,145</h3>
<p>I think the young folks of us have gotten email threats from reporters and the public alike.</p>
<p>我认为我们的年轻员工也收到了来自记者和公众的电子邮件威胁。</p>
<p>Despite the acts of hatred, vandalism, and crime, Musk says he has no regrets about doing the work that they're doing for and with President Trump.</p>
<p>尽管面临仇恨、破坏和犯罪行为，马斯克表示他对与特朗普总统合作的工作毫无悔意。</p>

<h3>00:01:24,640</h3>
<p>Do you regret coming out and supporting President Trump?</p>
<p>你后悔公开支持特朗普总统吗？</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>不后悔。</p>
<p>If um President Trump had not won, I think the Democrat campaign to import vast numbers of illegal voters would have succeeded and they would have naturalized vast numbers of illegals during the the sort of commit regime.</p>
<p>如果特朗普总统没有获胜，我认为民主党引入大量非法选民的运动就会成功，他们会在某种政权下让大量非法移民入籍。</p>

<h3>00:01:46,862</h3>
<p>Um and they would have turned America into a one party state from which we could never escape.</p>
<p>嗯，他们会把美国变成一个我们永远无法逃脱的一党制国家。</p>
<p>So a few things to unpack here, Alisia.</p>
<p>所以这里有几件事需要分析，阿莉西亚。</p>
<p>There's a media angle again because these are interviews that Musk is doing on this network, which is great.</p>
<p>这又涉及媒体角度，因为马斯克是在这个网络上接受采访，这很好。</p>

<h3>00:02:03,934</h3>
<p>But when it comes to a lot of the threats and not just threats, acts of violence, seems to be not the blaring headline story that it might be if certain roles were reversed.</p>
<p>但当涉及大量威胁甚至暴力行为时，这些似乎并没有成为头条新闻，而如果角色互换，情况可能会不同。</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>嗯，是的。</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>And it's not treated um as alarmingly as we're treating it as it should be, especially when you talk about these Tesla attacks.</p>
<p>而且它没有被当作应该警惕的事情来对待，尤其是当你谈论这些特斯拉袭击事件时。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p><a name="block-8"></a></p>
<h3>00:02:21,297</h3>
<p>But then we also connect these if we talk about this teacher in Maine who put out this message on Facebook and then you talk about the attacks attacks on Tesla the dealerships and also the people who own Teslas or just trying to go to work.</p>
<p>但如果我们谈到缅因州那位在Facebook上发布消息的老师，然后再谈到对特斯拉经销商以及特斯拉车主或只是去上班的人的袭击，我们也会把这些联系起来。</p>
<p>I think there are people on the what we are seeing uh and I think it's backed up of why what we're seeing in the media is that the people on the extreme side of the left are f starting to expect this from themselves this kind of behavior and so they have normalized it and it's becoming ever more violent when it's coming from a high school teacher and the fact that this teacher right now still may have a job still may have a job that should not be up for discussion right now because you have students who on Monday will be going to class.</p>
<p>我认为我们看到的一些人，而且我认为媒体所报道的情况也支持这一点，即左翼极端分子开始期待自己这种行为，因此他们已经将其常态化，而当这种行为来自一名高中老师时，它变得更加暴力，而且这名老师现在可能仍然有工作，这甚至不应该成为讨论的话题，因为周一学生们还要去上课。</p>

<p>What are those parents supposed to do in this situation?</p>
<p>在这种情况下，那些父母应该怎么做？</p>
<p>Do they approach the school?</p>
<p>他们应该去找学校吗？</p>
<p>What do they do?</p>
<p>他们该怎么办？</p>
<p>But I do believe it's becoming way too normal.</p>
<p>但我确实认为这变得太正常了。</p>
<p>Joe, the one story that we mentioned there, you had someone who has been accused and arrested and charged with firebombing a Tesla dealership, and a judge bought the defense's argument that that person should be walking free on the streets pending trial because the person has ADHD, depression, and gender dysphoria, and going to jail and being behind bars might interrupt or disrupt so-called gender affirming care.</p>
<p>乔，我们提到的那件事中，有人被指控、逮捕并因纵火袭击特斯拉经销商而被起诉，而法官接受了辩方的论点，认为此人应该在候审期间自由行走，因为他患有多动症、抑郁症和性别焦虑症，入狱可能会中断所谓的性别肯定治疗。</p>

<h3>00:03:36,963</h3>
<p>That's what a judge accepted and ruled.</p>
<p>这就是法官接受并裁决的。</p>
<p>What's it going to take during these firebombings of Tesla dealerships where somebody actually gets killed or seriously hurt?</p>
<p>在这些特斯拉经销商纵火袭击中，要等到有人真的被杀或受重伤才会采取行动吗？</p>
<p>Remember in Oregon, there was a dealership there that was shot up twice, actual bullets.</p>
<p>还记得俄勒冈州有一家经销商被枪击两次，用的是真子弹。</p>

<h3>00:03:50,022</h3>
<p>You know, what if there were some workers in the building?</p>
<p>如果有工人在大楼里怎么办？</p>
<p>I I can't even believe that we have judges that are allowing people like this to walk free.</p>
<p>我甚至无法相信我们有法官允许这样的人自由行走。</p>
<p>And you heard this counterargument, of course, when conservatives were boycotting Bud Light and they were saying, "Well, you did the same thing with Bud Light."</p>
<p>当然，你也听到了这种反驳，当保守派抵制百威淡啤时，他们说：“你们对百威淡啤也做了同样的事。”</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-12"></a></p>
<h3>00:04:05,273</h3>
<p>No, actually, um, at last check, conservatives weren't firebombing Bud Light factories and they weren't vandalizing Bud Light trucks.</p>
<p>不，实际上，据最新检查，保守派并没有纵火袭击百威淡啤工厂，也没有破坏百威淡啤的卡车。</p>
<p>But this is allowed because judges are allowing, but more importantly, find me a prominent Democrat who has come out and said this is wrong.</p>
<p>但这是被允许的，因为法官允许，更重要的是，找一个站出来说这是错误的知名民主党人。</p>

<h3>00:04:19,780</h3>
<p>This should stop.</p>
<p>这应该停止。</p>
<p>This is an American company with 125,000 workers.</p>
<p>这是一家拥有12.5万名员工的美国公司。</p>
<p>They won't do it because that will look like it's support of Elon Musk when it's really just common sense and supporting American workers and a company that has produced a lot of jobs and a lot of great vehicles.</p>
<p>他们不会这样做，因为这看起来像是在支持埃隆·马斯克，而实际上这只是常识，支持美国工人和一家创造了大量就业机会和优秀汽车的公司。</p>
