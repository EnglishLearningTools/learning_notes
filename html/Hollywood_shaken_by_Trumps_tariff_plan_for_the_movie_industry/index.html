<h3>00:00:00,000</h3>
<p>President Trump unveiling a fresh set of tariffs today, this time on the movie industry.</p>
<p>特朗普总统今日宣布新一轮关税，这次针对电影行业。</p>
<p>He says he's soon going to meet with representatives from the American film industry to discuss his plan to apply new tariffs to foreign made films.</p>
<p>他表示将很快与美国电影业代表会面，讨论对外国电影征收新关税的计划。</p>
<p>Let's bring in CNN's senior white House correspondent, Kristen Holmes, who is live for us outside the white House.</p>
<p>现在连线CNN驻白宫资深记者克里斯滕·霍姆斯，她在白宫外为我们现场报道。</p>

<p>And we're thrilled to have you here in the arena for the first time, Kristen, thank you so much.</p>
<p>我们非常高兴首次在演播室见到你，克里斯滕，非常感谢。</p>
<p>This is like another example, right, of the president continuing this push on tariffs which he is, you know, obviously very personally invested in.</p>
<p>这像是总统推动关税的又一例证，他显然对此非常执着。</p>

<h3>00:00:36,435</h3>
<p>But it seems very unclear how this one would actually work.</p>
<p>但目前尚不清楚具体如何实施。</p>
<p>Yeah. That's right.</p>
<p>是的，没错。</p>
<p>This is an industry that has a lot of ins and outs.</p>
<p>这个行业错综复杂。</p>
<p>And the way that this would work is really questionable, because it's not as though you're just taxing one product that is made in one place.</p>
<p>具体操作方式存疑，因为电影并非单一地点生产的商品。</p>

<h3>00:00:49,582</h3>
<p>You're talking about a movie which, as we know, a lot of the different production houses are scattered across the globe.</p>
<p>众所周知，电影制作涉及遍布全球的多个制作方。</p>
<p>They have different places that they have been places that things are edited.</p>
<p>拍摄和剪辑可能分散在不同地区。</p>
<p>So how you actually do this is really there's there's a lot of questions now.</p>
<p>因此实际操作存在诸多疑问。</p>

<p>This is what he said.</p>
<p>以下是他的原话。</p>
<p>He posted this on Truth Social.</p>
<p>他在Truth Social上发文称：</p>
<p>He said the movie industry in America is a is a dying very fast death.</p>
<p>"美国电影业正在迅速衰亡。"</p>
<p>Excuse me, is dying a very fast death.</p>
<p>抱歉，是"正在迅速衰亡"。</p>
<p>Other countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States.</p>
<p>其他国家正提供各种优惠吸引我们的电影人和工作室离开美国。</p>

<p>We want movies made in America.</p>
<p>我们希望电影在美国制作。</p>
<p>Kevin Liptak, our senior white House reporter, did learn that Donald Trump had dinner or met with actor Jon Voight over the weekend.</p>
<p>白宫资深记者凯文·利普塔克获悉，特朗普上周末与演员乔恩·沃伊特共进晚餐。</p>
<p>Who is one of his liaisons to Hollywood, a big Trump supporter.</p>
<p>沃伊特是特朗普在好莱坞的联络人之一，也是其忠实支持者。</p>

<h3>00:01:30,856</h3>
<p>So that could have played into this.</p>
<p>这可能是影响因素之一。</p>
<p>It's a factor.</p>
<p>确实是个因素。</p>
<p>But we also heard Donald Trump kind of seeming like he might be walking this back a little bit when he was just asked a question about it.</p>
<p>但特朗普被问及此事时似乎有所退让。</p>
<p>Take a listen.</p>
<p>请听这段录音。</p>
<p>Hollywood doesn't do very much of that business.</p>
<p>"好莱坞相关业务并不多。"</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>

<p><a name="block-8"></a></p>
<h3>00:01:46,873</h3>
<p>They have the nice sign and everything's good, but they don't do very much.</p>
<p>"他们有漂亮的标志，一切看起来不错，但实际业务很少。"</p>
<p>A lot of it's been taken to other countries and big proportion, and I'm actually going to meet with some because, you know, there's some advantage I guess, and I'm not looking to hurt the industry.</p>
<p>"大部分业务已转移到其他国家，我将与相关人士会面，因为可能存在某些好处，我不想伤害这个行业。"</p>

<p>I want to help the industry.</p>
<p>"我想帮助这个行业。"</p>
<p>So you can hear that clearly.</p>
<p>可以清楚听到。</p>
<p>He had talked to somebody who said it might hurt the industry because as he said, they didn't want to hurt the industry.</p>
<p>有人提醒他这可能损害行业，因此他表态不愿造成伤害。</p>
<p>That there could be some advantages.</p>
<p>可能存在某些好处。</p>
<p>As we know, there are a lot of advantages to these various productions being filmed overseas, like tax incentives.</p>
<p>众所周知，海外拍摄有诸多优势，比如税收优惠。</p>

<h3>00:02:13,599</h3>
<p>So it's interesting to see where this actually goes again, possibly making it a lot more expensive for American companies to make movies to then have, you know, sell to American consumers.</p>
<p>后续发展值得关注，这可能大幅增加美国公司制作并面向国内消费者销售电影的成本。</p>
<p>Kristen Holmes, thank you.</p>
<p>谢谢克里斯滕·霍姆斯。</p>
<p>Great to see you.</p>

<p>So with no end in sight for Trump's trade war with China the president is doubling down on this cheerful Christmas in July message for Americans.</p>
<p>随着中美贸易战持续，总统在七月向美国人传达"欢乐圣诞"讯息时态度更趋强硬。</p>
<p>I'm just saying they don't need to have $30 dolls.</p>

<p>They don't need to have 250 pencils.</p>
<p>"不需要250支铅笔。"</p>
<p>They can have five.</p>
<p>"5支就够了。"</p>
<p>All I'm saying is that if you do that a young lady and ten year old girl nine year old girl, 15 year old girl doesn't need $30 dolls.</p>
<p>"我的意思是，10岁、9岁或15岁的女孩不需要30美元的娃娃。"</p>
<p>She can be very happy with 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.</p>
<p>"2到5美元的娃娃也能让她们很开心。"</p>

<p>"他可能不知道现在15岁女孩想要的是大象护肤品？"</p>
<p>I'm not cool enough to know what Elephant is.</p>

<p>And we'll let these guys argue about whether or not this matters in a second.</p>
<p>"先让他们讨论这事是否重要。"</p>
<p>But, one of our friends of the show was arguing this comment was going to be lost in the noise.</p>
<p>"但节目的一位朋友认为这番言论会被淹没。"</p>
<p>That may have been true if Trump attended that one time, but he said it that time and then a second time.</p>
<p>"如果特朗普只说一次或许如此，但他重复了两次。"</p>

<p>And, I mean, the Wall Street Journal wrote it this way, quote, past presidents have urged voters to tighten their belts because of war, pestilence, natural calamity, economic contagion or their predecessors mistakes.</p>
<p>"《华尔街日报》写道：'以往总统因战争、瘟疫、自然灾害、经济危机或前任错误而呼吁选民节衣缩食'"</p>
<p>Mr. Trump is the first to do so because of his own policy decisions and his stubborn insistence on sticking with them.</p>
<p>"特朗普是首位因自身政策且固执坚持而如此表态的总统。"</p>

<h3>00:03:50,963</h3>
<p>In Mr. Trump's America, you get $2 dolls, only you pay more, and you'd be sure to thank the man in the handmade silk tie.</p>
<p>"在特朗普的美国，你得到2美元娃娃却支付更多，还得感谢系手工丝绸领带的那位。"</p>
<p>All the way out.</p>

<p>Well, enough said.</p>
<p>"好吧，无需多言。"</p>
<p>I don't think I can top that.</p>
<p>"我无法超越这个评价。"</p>
<p>Yes. I felt this was going to be a big deal also, because it would have been malpractice on the Democrats side if they hadn't made it a big deal.</p>

<h3>00:04:12,718</h3>
<p>So just that alone.</p>
<p>"仅此一点就够了。"</p>
<p>But but but I will say this, the way that this is being portrayed is that everyone is rich in America, and they're going to have 30 dollar dolls and you can just have 2 or 3.</p>
<p>"但当前舆论呈现的方式暗示所有美国人都很富裕，能买30美元娃娃，现在只能买2美元的。"</p>
<p>But the fact is that there are a lot of kids who aren't and a lot of families who aren't and if dolls are more expensive, it might mean that they get no dolls.</p>
<p>"事实上很多孩子和家庭负担不起，若娃娃涨价，可能意味着他们什么也得不到。"</p>

<h3>00:04:33,538</h3>
<p>So it's not just this idea of like, everyone is just crazy mad and buying as much as they can.</p>
<p>"所以不仅是'人们疯狂购物'的问题。"</p>
<p>Which, by the way, America was built on, it's the capitalist system, but it's also this idea that there are a lot of people who can't afford things.</p>
<p>"虽然美国建立在资本主义体系上，但现实是很多人无力消费。"</p>
<p>And if things are more expensive that means that maybe Little Jim or Little Susie might not get their dolls that they want because they're action figures.</p>
<p>"商品涨价可能导致小吉姆或小苏西得不到想要的动作玩偶。"</p>

<p>"纯粹从选举角度...我明白你的意思，听到这种言论我很惊讶。"</p>
<p>I think on Sunday, I was surprised you're kind of as a repeat thing.</p>

<h3>00:05:53,252</h3>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>"是的。"</p>
<p>And I think one of the things like whether it's politicians I talked to or like corporate leaders like you always want to emphasize the solution.</p>
<p>"无论是政客还是企业领袖，都应强调解决方案。"</p>
<p>You always want to emphasize the positive.</p>
<p>"始终聚焦积极面。"</p>
<p>And it helps if there is medicine to be taken or there's bad news somewhere in an answer or in a decision, in a circumstance.</p>
<p>"即便需要接受苦药或存在坏消息时也应如此。"</p>

<p><a name="block-24"></a></p>
<h3>00:06:08,567</h3>
<p>Emphasizing the positive and emphasizing the solution helps the listener and just people you're dealing with understand it.</p>
<p>"强调积极面和解决方案有助于听众和理解。"</p>
<p>It puts a better spin in the conversation.</p>
<p>"能让对话更顺畅。"</p>
<p>So leading with the negative and leading with what you're not getting as opposed to what you are getting, or you could be getting the benefits of this, I think, is an interesting tactic.</p>
<p>"因此以负面信息开场，强调'不能得到什么'而非'可能获益'，是种有趣策略。"</p>

<p>"我个人很感兴趣。"</p>
<p>It reflects the reality of the situation we could be in later this year.</p>
<p>"这反映了今年晚些时候可能面临的现实。"</p>
<p>And the president's repeatedly said that, you know, there may be less supply of some things, that we may see higher prices.</p>
