<h1>Poilievre asked what he learned after the election loss</h1>
<p>【波利耶夫被问及选举失败后的反思】</p>
<p>Summary:
Well, what we learned is that the electoral map has changed dramatically, making 41% of votes insufficient to form government despite being the best result since 1988. The challenge now is retaining 8 million voters while attracting another million to secure victory, requiring community engagement and team expansion.</p>
<p>摘要：
我们认识到选举版图已发生巨大变化，尽管获得自1988年以来的最佳成绩41%选票仍不足以组建政府。当前挑战在于保留800万选民的同时再争取100万选票以实现胜利，这需要深入社区互动并扩大团队规模。</p>

<h3>00:00:00,080</h3>
<p>Well, what we learned, I think we all learned is that the map has changed dramatically.</p>
<p>我们认识到，选举版图已经发生了巨大变化。</p>
<p>Like, if you had told me that uh for one, that we would get 41% of the vote a couple years ago, I would have said, "Wow, that's ambitious."</p>
<p>就像，如果几年前有人告诉我我们会获得41%的选票，我会说"哇，这太激进了"。</p>
<p>But if you told me that we would get 41% of the vote and still not win, I would have said, "Uh, you're crazy."</p>
<p>但如果有人说我们获得41%选票却仍无法胜选，我会回答"你疯了"。</p>

<h3>00:00:19,764</h3>
<p>But in fact, our our electoral map has changed.</p>
<p>但事实上，我们的选举版图确实改变了。</p>
<p>It's at this point right now it could it could change again but right now it's looking more and more like a two-party map where getting 41% by the way the best result that we've had since 1988 is not enough uh was not enough to form government.</p>
<p>目前形势可能再次变化，但越来越呈现两党格局——尽管41%是我们自1988年以来的最佳成绩，却不足以组建政府。</p>

<h3>00:00:39,190</h3>
<p>So, we have to ask ourselves, how do we first of all keep the enormous number of the 8 million people who voted for us uh that which is two and a almost 2 and a half million more than the previous time, but then add another uh roughly million votes that will allow us to get over the finish line.</p>
<p>因此我们必须思考：如何首先保住800万支持者（比上次增加近250万），再争取约100万选票以跨越终点线。</p>
<p>And that's something we're going to be talking with.</p>
<p>这正是我们要探讨的问题。</p>

<h3>00:00:58,545</h3>
<p>Uh we have to spend a lot of the summer listening carefully to people uh in the community's coffee shops and uh town halls and other events.</p>
<p>我们将在夏季深入社区咖啡馆、市政厅等活动场所倾听民意。</p>
<p>we can find out who are the people that are most likely to join this growing movement and get us over the finish line.</p>
<p>从而找出最可能加入这场壮大中的运动并助我们冲线的人群。</p>

<h3>00:01:15,760</h3>
<p>Why are you running in a world writing burn to stay on your team?</p>
<p>（原文含不完整表述，暂保留原句）</p>
<p>Listen, we we've got a she did a lot of hard work and our team has a lot to be proud of.</p>
<p>听着，我们的团队付出了巨大努力，有很多值得骄傲的成就。</p>
<p>We've got uh as I said, we've expanded our support.</p>
<p>如我所言，我们扩大了支持基础。</p>
<p>We've broadened our team.</p>
<p>我们拓展了团队规模。</p>
<p>We've got 25 new members of parliament, but we have to go further.</p>
<p>虽然新增了25位国会议员，但还需更进一步。</p>

<h3>00:01:32,714</h3>
<p>So, we're going to be enlarging our team and that's one of the things we'll be talking about today in our caucus.</p>
<p>因此我们将继续扩充团队，这将是今日党团会议议题之一。</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>谢谢。</p>
