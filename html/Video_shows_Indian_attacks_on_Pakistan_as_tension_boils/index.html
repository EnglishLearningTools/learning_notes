<p>白宫对此有何表态？</p>
<p>Yes, obviously, this has been something that the white House has been monitoring very closely for roughly two weeks now.</p>
<p>白宫过去两周一直在密切关注此事。</p>
<p>And they had said after the attack that essentially, from what we've been hearing from senior officials, this includes the vice president himself that they, recognize that there needs to be some sort of a response from India, that they supported that.</p>

<p>国务卿兼国家安全顾问马可·卢比奥昨日也表态。</p>
<p>He essentially said that he echoed the president's comments, and that he hopes this ends quickly and will continue to get engaged with both India and Pakistani leadership towards a peaceful resolution.</p>
