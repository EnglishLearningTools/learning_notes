<p>I mean clearly um the United States, the president, the department of defense, secretary Rubio here at the State Department have made it clear uh that what the Houthies have been doing when it comes to certainly the shipping lanes, the attacks on our ships, um hundreds on commercial ships, on our military uh ships as well, that this will not stand and we have struck them.</p>
<p>显然，美国总统、国防部和国务院的卢比奥部长已明确表示，胡塞武装对航运通道、商船和美军舰船的数百次袭击是不可接受的，我们已对他们实施打击。</p>

<p>that the only way forward for Gaza, and the president has noted this as well, that Hamas must not exist within the framework of of of anything, they've got to be obliterated, and that every single hostage, and there are still several Americans, including Edon Alexander, who are being held by those monsters, that all the hostages must be released.</p>
<p>加沙的唯一出路是哈马斯必须被彻底消灭，总统也指出这一点，所有人质，包括被这些怪物扣押的几名美国人如埃登·亚历山大，都必须获释。</p>

<p>以色列显然会采取他们认为必要的自卫行动，我们支持盟友，理解他们对也门和导弹袭击的反应，这些都属自卫范畴，但哈马斯不能继续存在。</p>
