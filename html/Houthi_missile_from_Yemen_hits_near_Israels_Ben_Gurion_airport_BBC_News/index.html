<p>Uh those negotiations, the international efforts for a new deal uh not only to guarantee the release of the hostages but also uh for for a ceasefire in Gaza have failed to reach any kind of of of deal.</p>

<p>And uh also part of this strategy uh is this blockade on the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p>
<p>该战略还包括封锁人道主义援助进入加沙。</p>
<p>And we've seen some, you know, dramatic uh reports of of the situation in Gaza where aid agencies say that food supplies, water, medicine are running low and they've been saying that this is a policy of starvation that could amount to a war crime, something that the Israeli authorities reject.</p>
<p>我们已看到一些关于加沙局势的严峻报告，援助机构称食品、水和药品即将耗尽，并表示这可能是构成战争罪的饥饿政策，以色列当局对此予以否认。</p>

<p>我们看到以色列国内出现一些反战抗议。</p>
<p>We've seen also, you know, some former officials, military officials urging the authorities to end the war in Gaza and there has been this suspicion for quite some time that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is prolonging the conflict to guarantee his political survival.</p>
<p>还看到一些前官员、军方官员敦促当局结束加沙战争，且长期以来有怀疑认为以色列总理内塔尼亚胡为保障自身政治生存而延长冲突。</p>

<p>Hugo Beta there. Well, I also spoke to Dr. Ha Helier from the Royal United Services Institute.</p>

<p><a name="block-15"></a></p>
<h3>00:04:39,025</h3>
<p>This was a missile that came from the Houthis in Yemen.</p>
<p>这是一枚来自也门胡塞武装的导弹。</p>
<p>Um I don't think it can be disagregated from the overall conflict of course that's going on in terms of Israel's war in Gaza.</p>
<p>我认为这显然无法与以色列在加沙的战争这一整体冲突割裂看待。</p>
<p>The Houthis have made that very clear.</p>
<p>胡塞武装已明确表态。</p>
<p>Uh of course they're a terrible group, but they're not striking just out of nowhere.</p>
<p>他们固然是恶劣组织，但袭击并非无端发生。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-16"></a></p>
<h3>00:04:58,497</h3>
<p>Um the question is is whether or not we will see measures to deescalate the situation comprehensively so that there wouldn't be further strikes of this nature.</p>
<p>问题在于我们是否会看到全面降级局势的措施以避免此类袭击再次发生。</p>
<p>Um or if we're going to see escalation in which case uh we're going to see uh more pain and suffering uh for the Yemenes and frankly for people throughout the region including Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
<p>抑或局势升级，届时也门人乃至整个地区包括以色列和巴勒斯坦民众将承受更多痛苦。</p>

<p><a name="block-17"></a></p>
<h3>00:05:20,088</h3>
<p>Uh what's your analysis of this expected move that thousands of reserveists are to be called up in Israel to expand the operation, the Israeli operation in Gaza?</p>
<p>您对以色列拟征召数千预备役人员以扩大加沙军事行动有何分析？</p>
<p>So I think it's been very clear for many months um that there isn't an intention from within Tel Aviv, within the Israeli government to end the war in Gaza.</p>
<p>我认为数月来已很清楚，特拉维夫内部、以色列政府内部无意结束加沙战争。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-18"></a></p>
<h3>00:05:43,360</h3>
<p>They've made it abundantly clear as your cor mentioned Israel ended the ceasefire back in March.</p>
<p>正如贵台记者所述，以色列三月份就结束了停火，其意图已非常明确。</p>
<p>Um and Israeli officials and Israeli ministers have uh said very clearly they do not want to end the war in Gaza until they see uh the the complete end of Hamas in Gaza.</p>
<p>以色列官员和部长们明确表示，除非看到哈马斯在加沙被彻底消灭，否则不会结束战争。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-19"></a></p>
<h3>00:06:01,577</h3>
<p>Um which of course is not something that any military expert thinks is possible.</p>
<p>这当然是任何军事专家都认为不可能实现的目标。</p>
<p>um the protests that you've seen um over not just the last few days but you know many months now uh from Israelis indicate that there's a great deal of public support uh in Israel among the Israeli public uh for the notion that this war is being pro prosecuted not to rescue the hostages um but to prolong Benjamin Netanyahu's rule as prime minister um and I don't think that there's really much doubt about that uh including including among, I suspect, Israeli allies as well.</p>
<p>不仅近日而是数月来以色列国内的抗议表明，许多公众支持一种观点，即这场战争是为延长内塔尼亚胡总理统治而非营救人质，我认为包括以色列盟友在内都对此少有怀疑。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-20"></a></p>
<h3>00:06:39,763</h3>
<p>The the the ceasefire uh proposal that was put forward by Biden and then finally implemented via a deal that involved the Biden administration and then the incoming Trump administration had phase one, phase two, phase three.</p>
<p>拜登提出并由拜登政府与即将上任的特朗普政府通过协议最终实施的停火提案分三个阶段。</p>
<p>Phase one was never truly implemented, then was violated almost from day one.</p>
<p>第一阶段从未真正落实，且几乎从第一天起就被违反。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-21"></a></p>
<h3>00:06:58,898</h3>
<p>Um and phase two, of course, we never entered into and there's really no suggestion that that's going to be returned to.</p>
<p>第二阶段我们当然从未进入，也完全没有迹象表明会重回该阶段。</p>
<p>There's already been a deal mentioned quite a few times over the last few months uh for all of the hostages to be released all at once in exchange for an end to the war.</p>
<p>过去几个月已多次提及一次性释放所有人质以换取战争结束的协议。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-22"></a></p>
<h3>00:07:14,534</h3>
<p>Israel has rejected that and I think that that's the the stance that it's going to persist on taking.</p>
<p>以色列已拒绝该协议，我认为其将坚持这一立场。</p>
<p>So we've seen repeated protests in Israel for the past 18 months calling on the hostages to be returned.</p>
<p>过去18个月我们看到以色列反复出现要求归还人质的抗议。</p>
<p>We've also increasingly seen over the past few weeks and very unusually some protests emerging in Gaza against Hamas.</p>
<p>过去几周我们还越来越多且异常地看到加沙出现反对哈马斯的抗议。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-23"></a></p>
<h3>00:07:32,282</h3>
<p>Um terrible suffering happening in Gaza.</p>
<p>加沙正发生可怕苦难。</p>
<p>Mhm. They hold more than 50 hostages, half of whom, it's believed, are dead in Gaza.</p>
<p>他们扣押着50多名人质，据信其中半数已在加沙死亡。</p>
<p>Why won't Hamas hand them back?</p>
<p>哈马斯为何不归还他们？</p>
<p>So, first, I don't think it's unusual that there are protests against Hamas.</p>
<p>首先，我认为出现反对哈马斯的抗议并不反常。</p>
<p>Um the the Palestinians of Gaza have a variety of political stances.</p>
<p>加沙巴勒斯坦人持多种政治立场。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-24"></a></p>
<h3>00:07:53,686</h3>
<p>I suspect Hamas is actually incredibly unpopular in Gaza, particularly over the past 18 months, but even before that.</p>
<p>我认为哈马斯在加沙极不受欢迎，尤其是过去18个月，甚至在此之前也是。</p>
<p>um visav why Hamas won't return the hostages for Hamas is a militant group and sees the hostages very clearly as being leverage uh the Israeli government has made it very clear that their final goal for Gaza is not simply the removal of Hamas but also the removal of the Palestinian population from Gaza it's expressed support for the Riviera plan has made it very clear that it supports the Riviera plan this new department within the Ministry of Defense uh which is set up in order to encourage uh the uh the quote unquote voluntary migration of Palestinians from Gaza.</p>
<p>至于哈马斯为何不归还人质——哈马斯作为武装组织明确将人质视为筹码，以色列政府已清楚表明其对加沙的终极目标不仅是清除哈马斯还包括驱逐巴勒斯坦人口，其表态支持"里维拉计划"并在国防部设立新部门以推动加沙巴勒斯坦人的"自愿迁移"。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-25"></a></p>
<h3>00:08:36,328</h3>
<p>Of course, there's nothing voluntary when you make a territory uninhabitable.</p>
<p>当然，当一片领土变得无法居住时，所谓"自愿"根本无从谈起。</p>
<p>Um so I don't think it's surprising.</p>
<p>因此我认为这并不令人意外。</p>
<p>I mean, Hamas is not a good actor by any means, but it's not surprising that they wouldn't release what they see as their leverage.</p>
<p>哈马斯绝非善类，但他们不会放弃自认为的筹码并不出奇。</p>
