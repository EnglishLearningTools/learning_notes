<p>摘要：
特朗普总统在椭圆形办公室宣布，华盛顿特区将于2027年在国家广场举办NFL选秀大会，预计吸引逾百万参与者。他强调了该活动带来的经济效益，包括促进旅游业和创造就业机会，并对计划在RFK体育场旧址为华盛顿指挥官队新建的6.5万座体育场表示赞赏。特朗普指出体育运动对团结国家、提升华盛顿特区安全与市容的重要性。市长穆丽尔·鲍泽和NFL总裁罗杰·古德尔对特朗普的支持表示感谢。发布会还涉及其他议题，包括世界杯、美加关系、移民政策（含针对无证移民的自愿离境计划），以及象征性重开阿尔卡特拉斯岛以彰显法律与秩序。特朗普简要谈及加沙人道主义危机，承诺提供援助的同时指责哈马斯阻碍物资输送。记者会在对NFL选秀公告背后合作精神的掌声与致谢中结束。</p>
