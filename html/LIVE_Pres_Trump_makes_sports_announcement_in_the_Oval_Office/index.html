<p>Uh we all love it.</p>
<p>我们都热爱它。</p>
<p>We all watch it and uh it brings people together.</p>
<p>我们观看比赛，它凝聚人心。</p>
<p>And so what a great way to celebrate um the United States of America, the NFL, and the Washington Commanders.</p>
<p>这是庆祝美国、NFL和华盛顿指挥官队的绝佳方式。</p>
<p>And President Trump, we we leave on your desk a Trump jersey.</p>
<p>特朗普总统，我们在您桌上留了一件印有您名字的指挥官队球衣。</p>

<p>Uh you are the ultimate commander, so it is a commander jersey.</p>
<p>您是最高的指挥官，所以这是指挥官队球衣。</p>
<p>Uh there's no there's no bird on it, but uh you know, we uh we do uh we appreciate you and thank you for everything you've done and uh look forward to the future.</p>
<p>上面没有鹰徽，但我们衷心感谢您的一切付出，并期待未来。</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>非常感谢。</p>
<p>Miles behind, but nevertheless, visually right behind it.</p>
<p>我得说，呃，乔希不久前起草了一份非常棒的草案。</p>

<p>So, it's it's going to be an architect's dream.</p>
<p>我认为你们确实拥有一位了不起的四分卫。</p>
<p>Whoever the architect has chosen and the owner, it's uh going to be something special.</p>
<p>关于体育场或其他方面，有任何问题吗？</p>
<p>I think it's going to be great for the area.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>going to be uh it will be top of the line.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>I know these people very well and they only know about top of the line and I would say that more will be put on into the stadium than would be put into a identical stadium of a similar size.</p>
<p>呃，关于选秀，我想提一个已经在此提及的活动——世界杯。</p>

<h3>00:10:16,358</h3>
<p>I think they're going to do a special because of the importance of the location.</p>
<p>总统先生，您如何看待这次在美国举办的世界杯？</p>
<p>I have no doubt they'll do a special job.</p>
<p>我为争取世界杯主办权付出了巨大努力。</p>
<p>Yeah, please.</p>
<p>顺便说一句，可别和罗杰在那座奖杯旁合影。</p>
<p>Can you explain a little bit about how you would implement tariffs on the film industry kind of how that would work?</p>
<p>呃，约翰尼是个好人，是他带来的。</p>

<h3>00:10:28,440</h3>
<p>Well, that's a different story.</p>
<p>你问得很有意思，它由蒂芙尼制作，会一直存放在这里直到世界杯前夕，之后交给冠军，这非常令人兴奋。</p>
<p>But our uh film industry has been decimated by other countries uh taking him out and also by incompetence.</p>
<p>我为争取这两项赛事付出了很多，我曾说当总统后可能无法亲临现场，但后来发生了奇妙的事——我意外当上了总统，而且任期超出预期。</p>
<p>Like in Los Angeles, the governor is a grossly incompetent man.</p>
<p>现在我们既有奥运会和世界杯，还有可能超越一切的盛事——美国建国250周年庆典。</p>

<p>He's just allowed it to be taken away from, you know, Hollywood.</p>
<p>所以，感谢提问，这是个很好的问题。</p>
<p>Hollywood doesn't do very much of that business.</p>
<p>是的。</p>
<p>They have the nice sign and everything's good, but they don't do very much.</p>
<p>目前俄罗斯是世界上领土最大的国家，其次是加拿大，然后是中国。</p>
<p>A lot of it's been taken to other countries and big proportion.</p>
<p>不，我从未这么想过，尽管骨子里我是个房地产开发商。</p>

<h3>00:10:55,022</h3>
<p>And I'm actually going to meet with some because you know there's some advantages I guess and I'm not looking to hurt the industry.</p>
<p>好的，请继续。</p>
<p>I want to help the industry.</p>
<p>为应对百万观众参加NFL选秀，是否需要增派安保和警力？</p>
<p>Uh but uh they given financing by other countries.</p>
<p>能承办选秀是莫大荣幸。</p>
<p>They've given a lot of things and uh the industry was decimated.</p>
<p>没有比这更壮观的场景了。</p>

<h3>00:11:10,732</h3>
<p>If you look at how little is done in this country now you know you think we were the ones we used to do a hundred not long ago 100%.</p>
<p>我毕生都在研究场地选址。</p>
<p>Now we do uh almost like very little.</p>
<p>有趣的是，我之前不清楚它相对国会大厦的位置，但体育场其实就在国会大厦正后方。</p>
<p>It's shocking.</p>
<p>虽然落后数英里，但视觉上却紧跟在后面。</p>
<p>Are you in that business too?</p>
<p>所以，这将成为建筑师的梦想之作。</p>
<p>because he's in so many businesses.</p>
<p>无论建筑师和业主选择了谁，这都将是非同寻常的。</p>

<h3>00:11:26,481</h3>
<p>You could you could explain it, but it's it's not a good situation.</p>
<p>我认为这对该地区将大有裨益。</p>
<p>So, we're going to meet with the industry.</p>
<p>这将是最顶级的配置。</p>
<p>I want to make sure they're happy with it.</p>
<p>我非常了解这些人，他们只追求顶尖水准。可以说，这座体育场的投入会远超同等规模的其他体育场。</p>
<p>Uh because we're all about jobs.</p>
<p>考虑到地理位置的重要性，我认为他们会打造得与众不同。</p>
<p>That's all what I'm you know, it's very important.</p>
<p>我毫不怀疑他们会做得非常出色。</p>

<h3>00:11:38,779</h3>
<p>It's a big industry, but it's an industry now that's uh it's really left it's abandoned the USA where it started and we'll get it we'll get it back.</p>
<p>好的，请讲。</p>
<p>Yeah, please.</p>
<p>能否请您解释一下如何对电影行业实施关税？具体会如何操作？</p>
<p>Uh thanks, Mr. President.</p>
<p>嗯，那就是另一回事了。</p>
<p>Um first, I just want to thank you for letting us in here.</p>
<p>但我们的电影业已被其他国家摧毁，他们抢走了生意，再加上自身的无能。</p>

<p>with Zero Hedge in the last administration banned us on social media.</p>
<p>比如洛杉矶的州长就是个极其无能的人。</p>
<p>So, we're really grateful to be in the White House and this is not exactly sports related, but um I've been dying to ask you this question for a long time, which is that two and a half years ago, the Nordstream pipeline blew up.</p>
<p>他就眼睁睁看着产业从好莱坞流失。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-35"></a></p>
<h3>00:12:08,760</h3>
<p>And despite what people like John Brennan and all the hawks said, you were one person who said Russia probably did not blow up its own pipeline.</p>
<p>好莱坞现在没多少业务了。</p>
<p>If you can believe they said Russia blew it up.</p>
<p>他们有漂亮的标志，表面光鲜，但实际产出很少。</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>大部分业务已被转移到其他国家，比例很高。</p>
<p>And so I'm wondering now that you're president if you would consider launching a formal investigation into what happened there and who actually did blow it up.</p>
<p>我其实准备和他们谈谈，毕竟有些优势，我也不想伤害这个行业。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-36"></a></p>
<h3>00:12:26,720</h3>
<p>Well, probably if I asked certain people, I'd be able to tell you without having to waste a lot of money on an investigation, but uh I think a lot of people know who blew it up, but I was the one that blew it up originally because I wouldn't let it be built.</p>
<p>我想帮助这个行业。</p>
<p>And then when Biden got in, he allowed it to be built.</p>
<p>但他们接受了其他国家的资金支持。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-37"></a></p>
<h3>00:12:42,870</h3>
<p>And uh it's very interesting.</p>
<p>这些国家提供了很多支持，导致我们的产业衰败。</p>
<p>But I think Russia with the price of oil right now, oil's gone down.</p>
<p>看看现在国内产量之少，要知道不久前我们还占据100%的份额。</p>
<p>I think we're in a good position to settle.</p>
<p>现在我们几乎所剩无几。</p>
<p>They want to settle.</p>
<p>这令人震惊。</p>
<p>Uh Ukraine wants to settle.</p>
<p>你也从事这个行业吗？</p>
<p>If I weren't president, nobody would be settling.</p>
<p>因为他涉足太多行业了。</p>
