<p>Well, what we've heard is actually incredible and it brings to mind a film really.</p>
<p>听到的情况确实匪夷所思，堪比电影情节。</p>
<p>We've seen uh I don't know if our viewers have seen the pictures of inside the cell which shows how the prisoners were able to remove a toilet and hack into the wall and all 10 of them get out down the side of the wall that way.</p>
<p>监控显示囚犯拆下马桶凿穿墙壁，十人全部由此逃脱。</p>

<p>They then went to um the loading bays that are used by uh delivery men, delivery people.</p>
<p>随后他们前往装卸区。</p>
<p>They then, and this is all on film, crossed the very busy interstate and you can see them in their um prison uniforms running out of the jail almost on mass.</p>
<p>画面记录他们穿着囚服集体穿越繁忙州际公路。</p>
<p>And what is also remarkable is that that video was taken by the prisons cameras, their own cameras at around 1:00 this morning.</p>
<p>值得注意的是监狱摄像头在凌晨1点就拍下这些画面。</p>

<p>But the prisoners didn't realize, the prison wardens didn't realize that anyone was missing till a routine headcount at 8:30 this morning.</p>
<p>但狱警直到今早8:30例行点名才发现有人失踪。</p>
<p>And that's when um they realized that not only 10 people, they thought it was 11 and then they then found one of the people inside of the jail.</p>
<p>当时他们以为是11人失踪，后来发现其中一人仍在狱中。</p>

<p>So it's a series of really really perplexing issues that you could do think how has this been able to happen?</p>
<p>这一连串问题令人费解：这怎么可能发生？</p>
<p>Not only that, when they found out at 8:30 this morning, it then took till lunchtime to let the public know and the media know by which time these fugitives have been at large for 11 hours.</p>
<p>更甚者，早上8:30发现后，直到午间才通知公众和媒体——此时逃犯已逍遥法外11小时。</p>

<p>So, it really is there is begging some serious serious questions for the sheriff's office.</p>
<p>这引发对警长办公室的严重质疑。</p>
<p>Yeah, and we've been watching some of that surveillance video there showing those inmates, you know, wrenching a door open, running out of the jail, and we saw, of course, that picture almost taunting the authorities where they wrote too easy lol over a hole in in one of the cells in that in that jail.</p>
<p>监控显示囚犯撬开门冲出监狱，他们在牢房破洞处留下"太简单了哈哈"的挑衅文字。</p>

<p>Uh, you mentioned there, seven of them still at large, three inmates are now in custody.</p>
<p>你提到七人仍在逃，三人已归案。</p>
<p>We heard a bit there from the chief of police and Kirkpatrick kind of calming down the public saying, you know, they're they're they're not in danger and yet people should still be mindful.</p>
<p>警方局长试图安抚公众称没有危险，但仍需保持警惕。</p>

<p>Do do we have a sense of you mentioned it's a small town, you know, the risk to the public as these people are still loose?</p>
<p>这是小城市，这些逃犯仍在逃，公众风险如何？</p>
<p>People are definitely definitely nervous and some members of um the community are definitely scared.</p>
<p>民众非常紧张，部分社区成员确实害怕。</p>
<p>These are all of these men have been accused of violent crimes.</p>

<p>She said um there were serious questions about why did it happen so close to the time when a new sheriff will be elected.</p>
<p>她质疑此事为何在新警长选举前夕发生。</p>

<p>Um what she hasn't said and which people were asking her repeatedly to do was if she was going to apologize for this happening on her watch.</p>
