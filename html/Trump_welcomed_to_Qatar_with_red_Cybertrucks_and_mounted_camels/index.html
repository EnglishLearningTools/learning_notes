<p>摘要：
美国总统在访问多哈期间的中东之行引发了地区和全球广泛关注。特朗普的到访仪式包括骆驼队列和致敬埃隆·马斯克的红色赛博卡车，并计划举行双边会议及可能达成的数千亿美元投资协议。启程前，特朗普谈及与叙利亚总统艾哈迈德·沙拉的会面，称赞其强势领导力，并宣布将解除对叙利亚制裁，归功于沙特与土耳其领导人的斡旋。特朗普随后出席海湾合作委员会会议，赞扬地区盟友。在多哈，其车队由赛博卡车开道，红毯迎接和骆驼骑兵队列尽显东道主的精心安排。卡塔尔在巴以冲突中的调解作用受关注，但重大协议仍未达成。特朗普派特使史蒂夫·怀科夫推动人质谈判。叙利亚议题聚焦关系正常化、加入《亚伯拉罕协议》及打击ISIS。卡塔尔向特朗普赠送波音飞机的提议引发道德争议。与此同时，以色列代表团抵多哈开展人质谈判，此前一名美国人质刚获释。</p>

<p>Is good to have you. Thank you very much. Elena Treanor, white House reporter is with us right now. Elena, this is significant what the president is doing.</p>
<p>"感谢您的分析。现在连线白宫记者埃琳娜·特雷纳。埃琳娜，总统此行意义重大。"</p>
<p>Cutter and the U.S. have had a longstanding military relationship, a lot of cooperation from Qatar in terms of the U.S. military Central Command.</p>
<p>"卡塔尔与美国长期保持军事合作，在中央司令部事务上给予大量支持。"</p>

<p>I've been to Camp Australia, a military base outside of Doha. I've been to, the air base where the U.S. has a lot of fighter jets, base.</p>
<p>"我曾到访多哈郊外的澳大利亚营军事基地，以及驻有美军战机的空军基地。"</p>
<p>So there's a lot of military cooperation between the U.S. and Qatar. But now this controversy has erupted over Qatar wanting to give, the president of the United States a plane.</p>
<p>"美卡军事合作密切，但当前争议焦点是卡塔尔欲向美国总统赠送飞机。"</p>

<p>That's right. And just some other things about Qatar recently, as well as that they've been a key mediating force in a lot of the talks that they are having, particularly between, the Israelis and Hamas.</p>
<p>"确实。卡塔尔近期还作为关键调解方参与多场谈判，尤其是巴以之间。"</p>
<p>They've been very helpful in dealing with Hamas, and wanting to know expand on the cease fire agreement. That, of course, has now fallen apart.</p>
<p>"其在应对哈马斯方面作用显著，曾推动扩大停火协议——尽管现已破裂。"</p>

<p>But yes, right now we just saw them signing, this that they had the signing ceremony on aviation, having, you know, buying planes from the U.S. and then also we're told that in a degree, an agreement on defense, of course.</p>
<p>"但眼下我们看到双方签署航空协议——采购美国飞机，据悉还有一定程度的防务协议。"</p>
<p>But I do think your point about the Boeing jet, I mean, that is the one thing that everyone is paying attention to.</p>
<p>"但波音飞机一事确实是当前焦点。"</p>

<p>And actually, the president made comments last night. He did an interview with Fox News's Sean Hannity where he actually suggested, I thought this was the most striking moment of that interview where he said, you know, the Qataris suggested to him, like, let us help you if we can help you lead us.</p>
<p>"总统昨晚接受福克斯新闻采访时透露，卡塔尔方面表示'请让我们协助您'——这是采访最惊人之处。"</p>
<p>And of course, we're seeing the president show that he's very amenable to that, that he wants to accept it. He's calling it a gift to the State Department.</p>
<p>"总统显然倾向接受，称其为'赠予国务院的礼物'。"</p>

<p>But of course, it raises serious ethical questions. We've heard now from a lot of Democrats, but also Republicans and some Trump allies, people like Laura Loomer, Ben Shapiro saying like, this is not ethical. This is not legal.</p>
<p>"但这引发严重道德质疑。民主党人、共和党人乃至特朗普盟友如劳拉·卢默、本·夏皮罗均指责此举不道德且违法。"</p>
<p>And so that's, of course, something that everyone is watching for today is what's actually going to happen with that.</p>
<p>"因此众人关注此事后续发展。"</p>

<p>And of course, as well, when you talk about the plane, which the president and his team are trying to refer to as this hotel in the sky, is that it would cost still hundreds of millions of dollars to try and retrofit it.</p>
<p>"总统团队称该飞机为'空中酒店'，但改装仍需耗资数亿美元。"</p>
<p>It would take years to do that. There are so many different, security implications of this.</p>
<p>"改装需时数年，且涉及复杂安全问题。"</p>

<p>You know, Secret Service has said that this would be a security nightmare. They'd have to tear the plane apart looking for surveillance devices that they'd have to add, some of the capabilities we know that Air Force One needs.</p>
<p>"特勤局称这是'安全噩梦'，需拆机检查监控设备，并加装'空军一号'必备功能。"</p>
<p>So that's going to be a huge deal if that actually comes together. The president himself, saying that he very much thinks that he should accept that. He even said he thought he'd be stupid not to say that. Indeed.</p>
<p>"若成真将影响重大。总统直言'不接受才是愚蠢'。"</p>

<p>and there's another major development unfolding in Doha, Qatar, today, and that is an Israeli delegation is heading to Doha to continue negotiations with the U.S..</p>
<p>"今日多哈另一要闻：以色列代表团将赴卡塔尔与美国继续谈判。"</p>
<p>Steve Whitcomb, the special U.S. envoy, is already there, with Hamas to see if they can get more hostages released.</p>
<p>"美国特使史蒂夫·惠特科姆已抵达，将与哈马斯商讨释放更多人质。"</p>

<p>Right. So this has been a huge deal. I mean, I think, first of all, of course, what, has been very encouraging to the Trump administration is what we saw happen on Monday with the release of Ethan Alexander, the last living, American hostage being held by Hamas.</p>
<p>"确实。特朗普政府深受周一最后一名在世美国人质伊森·亚历山大获释的鼓舞。"</p>
<p>That timing was so significant and very strategic, I believe, on behalf of Hamas, because they recognize, you know, they didn't get anything in return for releasing him.</p>
<p>"哈马斯选择此时机极具策略性——他们未要求任何回报。"</p>

<p>and it it is, I think, from my conversations with Trump administration officials, they are viewing this as a goodwill gesture. I think the president said so himself.</p>
<p>"据我与特朗普政府官员交流，他们认为这是善意姿态。总统本人亦如此表态。"</p>
<p>And so that's really the talks today, with Steve Wyckoff leading those from the United States side.</p>
<p>"因此今日由史蒂夫·怀科夫主导的谈判至关重要。"</p>

<p>It's going to be a key part of this is how many more hostages can they release.</p>
<p>"关键议题是能再释放多少人质。"</p>
<p>And of course, trying to view this as how can they get back to ceasefire talks, because we have seen that fall apart.</p>
<p>"同时试图重启已破裂的停火谈判。"</p>
<p>And all of this comes, of course, as there has been some frustration. We've been reporting behind the scenes with Trump administration officials and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
