<p>And until then, he has a bit of a to-do list on his plate.</p>
<p>在此之前，他手头有一些待办事项。</p>
<p>Here's a look at five things the prime minister will have in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<p>以下是总理未来几周和几个月内要处理的五件事。</p>
<p>[Music] The prime minister has said repeatedly that Canada's old relationship with the United States is over.</p>

<h3>00:00:31,909</h3>
<p>And so this meeting with the president is really about carving a path forward in the trade war between the two countries.</p>
<p>因此，与总统的会晤实际上是为两国之间的贸易战开辟一条前进的道路。</p>
<p>Carney said on Friday that he expects his meeting with Trump to be quote difficult but constructive unquote.</p>
<p>卡尼周五表示，他预计与特朗普的会晤将是“困难但有建设性的”。</p>
<p>The two have spoken by phone already where Trump seemed to tone down his talk of annexing Canada during the election campaign.</p>
<p>两人已经通过电话交谈，特朗普似乎在竞选期间淡化了吞并加拿大的言论。</p>

<h3>00:00:50,301</h3>
<p>While Trump often mocked former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, referring to him as the governor of Canada, he's yet to use that same language with [Music] Carney.</p>
<p>尽管特朗普经常嘲笑前总理贾斯汀·特鲁多，称他为“加拿大总督”，但他尚未对卡尼使用同样的言辞。</p>
<p>After winning the Liberal leadership in March, Carney swiftly appointed 23 MPs to his cabinet, not including himself.</p>
<p>在三月赢得自由党领导权后，卡尼迅速任命了23名议员进入内阁，不包括他自己。</p>

<h3>00:01:09,225</h3>
<p>It was smaller than Trudeau's last team, and Carney wouldn't say on Friday whether his post-election cabinet would be larger.</p>
<p>这比特鲁多的上一届团队规模小，卡尼周五未透露选举后的内阁是否会扩大。</p>
<p>[Music] Carney revealed on Friday that King Charles will deliver the throne speech when Parliament resumes.</p>
<p>[音乐] 卡尼周五透露，议会复会时，国王查尔斯将发表御座演讲。</p>
<p>Something that hasn't been done by a royal in almost half a century.</p>
<p>这是近半个世纪以来首次由王室成员完成。</p>

<p><a name="block-6"></a></p>
<h3>00:01:28,006</h3>
<p>The throne speech is written by the prime minister and his team and lays out the government's plans and priorities.</p>
<p>御座演讲由总理及其团队撰写，概述政府的计划和优先事项。</p>
<p>It's usually read by the Governor General, but Queen Elizabeth was the last monarch to do it back in 1977.</p>
<p>通常由总督宣读，但伊丽莎白女王是上一次在1977年这样做的君主。</p>
<p>[Music] One person who isn't in the house is Conservative leader Pierre Palv, at least not yet.</p>
<p>[音乐] 保守党领袖皮埃尔·帕尔夫尚未进入众议院，至少目前还没有。</p>

<h3>00:01:48,939</h3>
<p>On Friday, incumbent Conservative MP Damian Curick announced he will step aside from his seat in Battle River Crowoot to let Polyv run in the Alberta writing.</p>
<p>周五，现任保守党议员达米安·库里克宣布将让出他在巴特尔河-克罗伍特的席位，以便帕尔夫在阿尔伯塔补选中参选。</p>
<p>That means Carney will have to call a bi-election.</p>
<p>这意味着卡尼将不得不举行补选。</p>
<p>And while technically he doesn't have to call one for a year to replace the vacant seat, Carney told reporters on Friday he isn't playing any games with it and will ensure the bi-election happens as soon as possible.</p>
<p>尽管技术上他有一年时间填补空缺席位，但卡尼周五告诉记者，他不会拖延，将确保尽快举行补选。</p>

<h3>00:02:11,379</h3>
<p>[Music] At the very least, the government will need to introduce supply bills to get money flowing to departments.</p>
<p>[音乐] 政府至少需要提出供应法案，以确保资金流向各部门。</p>
<p>The last supplementary estimates bill was passed in November.</p>
<p>上一次补充预算案于11月通过。</p>
<p>Now, Carney ran on a platform of aggressive capital spending, and the party projected nearly $225 billion in deficits over four years.</p>
<p>卡尼以激进的资本支出为竞选纲领，该党预计四年内赤字将接近2250亿美元。</p>

<h3>00:02:32,143</h3>
<p>The party's plan includes $130 billion in new spending measures.</p>
<p>该党计划包括1300亿美元的新支出措施。</p>
<p>But Carney reiterated on Friday his intention is to slow the rate of growth in government operations costs, calling the 9% annual increase in spending in recent years unsustainable and promising to bring that down to 2%.</p>
<p>但卡尼周五重申，他打算放缓政府运营成本的增长速度，称近年来9%的年支出增长不可持续，并承诺将其降至2%。</p>

<h3>00:02:48,063</h3>
<p>He said he'll do that without cutting transfers to provinces or individuals.</p>
<p>他表示，他不会削减对省份或个人的转移支付。</p>
<p>[Music] It's a pledge he made before the election campaign when he hosted a meeting with the country's premers in Ottawa and vowed to table legislation by July 1st to allow goods to travel across the country barrierfree.</p>
<p>[音乐] 这是他在竞选前做出的承诺，当时他在渥太华与各省省长会晤，并誓言在7月1日前提出立法，允许货物在全国无障碍流通。</p>

<h3>00:03:08,017</h3>
<p>In March, he also said his government would remove labor mobility restrictions in federally regulated professions and eliminate duplication by recognizing provincial assessments for major projects.</p>
<p>三月，他还表示，他的政府将取消联邦监管职业的劳动力流动限制，并通过承认省级评估来消除重复工作。</p>
<p>Now, since the trade war began with the United States, most of Canada's premers have been pushing Ottawa in this direction.</p>
<p>自与美国贸易战开始以来，加拿大大多数省长一直在推动渥太华朝这个方向发展。</p>

<p>They argue that more free trade allows Canada to bolster its economy by opening up more domestic markets.</p>
<p>他们认为，更多的自由贸易可以通过开放更多国内市场来提振加拿大经济。</p>
<p>And that's a look into Prime Minister Mark Carney's to-do list over the next few weeks and months.</p>
<p>以上就是总理马克·卡尼未来几周和几个月的待办清单。</p>
