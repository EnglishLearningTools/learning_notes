<h3>00:00:00,033</h3>
<p>The president says he had a great meeting at the white House today with Canada's Prime Minister, Mark Carney, and the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>总统表示，他今天在白宫与加拿大总理马克·卡尼进行了很好的会晤。</p>
<p>He said afterwards, quote, I feel better about relations in many respects.</p>
<p>会后他表示：“我在很多方面对两国关系感觉更好了。”</p>
<p>So publicly at least, both sides seem pleased with the meeting, whether it was a typical meeting, though, or would be for any president not named Donald Trump.</p>
<p>至少公开来看，双方似乎对会晤感到满意，尽管这是否是一次典型会晤，或对其他非特朗普总统而言是否典型，是另一个问题。</p>

<h3>00:00:16,382</h3>
<p>That's another question, because here's what else Mr. Trump said just a few hours afterwards.</p>
<p>这是另一个问题，因为几小时后特朗普还说了以下内容。</p>
<p>As far as calling him Governor Carney. No, I haven't done that yet.</p>
<p>至于称呼他为卡尼州长，我还没那么做。</p>
<p>And maybe I won't.</p>
<p>也许我不会。</p>
<p>That's the first thing I'd say, suggesting that maybe he won't, but maybe he will call the newly elected leader of our closest neighbor governor as though Canada where the 51st state not typical except these days.</p>
<p>这是我要说的第一点，暗示他可能不会，但也可能将我们最亲密邻国的新任领导人称为州长，仿佛加拿大是第51个州——这在过去并不典型，但如今却有点是了。</p>

<p><a name="block-3"></a></p>
<h3>00:00:38,070</h3>
<p>It kind of is.</p>
<p>现在确实有点这样。</p>
<p>Nor is it typical for a visiting Canadian Prime Minister have to say twice to the president's face that his country is not for sale after his host, when asked about it, starts almost daydreaming out loud the this president and Mr. Prime Minister a lot of categories Foster's to Mr. president a view which said that Canada should become the 51st state.</p>
<p>同样不典型的是，来访的加拿大总理不得不两次当面告诉总统他的国家“不出售”，而东道主总统在被问及时，却几乎公开幻想加拿大应成为第51个州。</p>

<p>We're not joking.</p>
<p>我们没在开玩笑。</p>
<p>No no.</p>
<p>不不。</p>
<p>Well I still believe that but but you know it takes two to tango, right.</p>
<p>嗯，我仍然这么认为，但你知道这需要两厢情愿，对吧。</p>
<p>But, I think, you know, it's, it would really be a wonderful marriage because it's it's two places they get along very well.</p>
<p>但我觉得，这将是一段美妙的结合，因为两地相处非常融洽。</p>
<p>They like each other a lot.</p>
<p>他们彼此非常喜欢。</p>

<p>Well, if if, if I may, as you know from real estate, there are some places that, are never for sale.</p>
<p>呃，如果可以的话，正如您从房地产中知道的，有些地方是永远不出售的。</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>确实如此。</p>
<p>we're sitting in one right now.</p>
<p>我们现在就坐在其中一个地方。</p>
<p>You know, Buckingham Palace that you visited as well.</p>
<p>比如您也参观过的白金汉宫。</p>
<p>and, having met with, the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign, last several months, it's not for sale.</p>
<p>而且，经过过去几个月竞选期间与加拿大“业主们”的会面，加拿大不出售。</p>

<p>Won't be for sale.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, this time, after a question on tariffs, Prime Minister Carney came back to the 51st state issue.</p>
<p>几分钟后，在被问及关税问题时，卡尼总理再次回到第51个州的话题。</p>
<p>Mr. president, is there anything the Time Minister can say to you today to change your mind on tariffs in Canada?</p>
<p>总统先生，总理今天能否说些什么来改变您对加拿大关税的看法？</p>

<h3>00:01:52,344</h3>
<p>Tariffs on cars tariff in Canada?</p>
<p>汽车关税？加拿大的关税？</p>
<p>Is there anything he can say to you and of course of your needs of him today to get you to lift tariffs on.</p>
<p>他能否说些什么，当然也要满足您今天对他的要求，来让您取消关税？</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>不。</p>
<p>Why not.</p>
<p>为什么不行？</p>
<p>Just the way it is.</p>
<p>事情就是这样。</p>

<p>我是说如果加拿大人不想要。</p>
<p>Would you respect that.</p>
<p>您会尊重吗？</p>
<p>Sure I would.</p>
<p>当然会。</p>
<p>But this is not necessarily a one day deal.</p>
<p>但这不一定是朝夕可成的事。</p>
<p>This is over a period of time they have to make that decision.</p>
<p>他们需要时间来做决定。</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>是的。</p>

<p>Yeah, if I may.</p>
<p>好的，如果可以的话。</p>
<p>well, I respectfully Canadians view on this and is not going to change on the 51st day.</p>
<p>我尊重加拿大人的观点，这一点在第51天也不会改变。</p>
<p>The president also talked tariffs and showed him patients are being asked about whether he's reached any trade agreements with any country.</p>
<p>总统还谈到关税，并在被问及是否与任何国家达成贸易协议时表现出耐心。</p>

<h3>00:02:34,387</h3>
<p>So far.</p>
<p>截至目前。</p>
<p>Just to finish, we also have a situation because everyone says when, when, when are you going to sign deals?</p>
<p>最后，我们面临的情况是，所有人都在问“何时”签署协议。</p>
<p>We don't have to sign deals.</p>
<p>我们不必签署协议。</p>
<p>We could sign 25 deals right now, Howard, if we want it.</p>

<h3>00:02:51,638</h3>
<p>Well, keep an eye on us.</p>
<p>那就拭目以待吧。</p>
<p>The president is now just three days shy of a month into his three month tariff pause time, which he said would be used to strike trade agreements with the rest of the world, especially China, which he exempted from the pause and raised tariffs on to 145%.</p>
<p>总统的三个月关税暂停期已过去近一个月，仅剩三天。他称此期间将用于与世界其他国家达成贸易协议，尤其是中国——但中国被排除在暂停之外，关税被提高至145%。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-12"></a></p>
<h3>00:03:05,284</h3>
<p>So far, however, the administration has announced zero agreements with zero countries, and by the sound of the president's answer, there might not be any.</p>
<p>然而截至目前，政府尚未宣布与任何国家达成协议，而从总统的回答来看，可能不会有任何协议。</p>
<p>Which, by the way, is not surprising.</p>
<p>这并不令人意外。</p>
<p>In normal times.</p>
<p>在正常时期。</p>
<p>In past administrations, trade deals have taken many, many months, even years to hammer out the idea that even a framework for trade agreements would happen this fast was unlikely, but this president did put a timer on it.</p>
<p>往届政府的贸易协议需耗时数月甚至数年才能敲定，连框架协议都如此迅速本不太可能，但本届总统确实设定了时限。</p>

<h3>00:03:25,205</h3>
<p>And when asked more specifically about China, the administration's responses have been all over the place.</p>
<p>在被具体问及中国时，政府的回应却前后矛盾。</p>
<p>After President said that you have spoken to the presidency.</p>
<p>总统称你已与中方领导人通话。</p>
<p>When did that happen?</p>
<p>何时发生的？</p>
<p>China says it hasn't happened.</p>
<p>中方表示并无此事。</p>
<p>So numerous times.</p>
<p>多次如此。</p>
<p>So can you clarify, is the administration talking to Beijing specifically about tariffs or not?</p>
<p>能否澄清，政府是否正与北京专门讨论关税问题？</p>

<p>我们不会讨论谁在与谁对话。</p>
<p>Setting the stage for a deal with China.</p>
<p>这是在为与中国达成协议铺路。</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>这意味着什么？</p>
<p>Has the president spoken directly with XI and I don't have anything to read out on a direct talk between the President and President XI.</p>

<p>He was asked about China during a lengthy interview about two weeks ago with time magazine.</p>
<p>约两周前，他在接受《时代》杂志长篇采访时被问及中国。</p>
<p>The question was, Will you call President XI if he doesn't call you president Trump said no.</p>

<p>Now, the Chinese have consistently denied that any such call happened today.</p>
<p>而中方始终否认有过此类通话。</p>
<p>Testifying before Congress under oath.</p>

<hr />
<p><a name="block-20"></a></p>
<h3>00:05:12,478</h3>
<p>many things.</p>
<p>很多方面。</p>
<p>The main one is that all of these, foreign leaders go into the Oval Office with President Trump in something of a no win situation, because the president sets the terms of what he wants it to be.</p>
<p>主要是所有外国领导人与特朗普总统在椭圆形办公室会面时都处于某种无胜算境地，因为总统设定了他想要的条款。</p>
<p>He did a truth post before this meeting started.</p>
<p>会晤前他发了篇“真相帖”。</p>

<p>他显然一直在谈论第51个州。</p>
<p>He has been talking about trade.</p>
<p>他一直在谈论贸易。</p>
<p>And so Carney, who has been pretty tough and who was elected in part as backlash to Trump in Canada had a choice, to make on how he was going to handle it.</p>
<p>因此，以对特朗普强硬著称、某种程度上因加拿大反特朗普情绪当选的卡尼，必须决定如何应对。</p>

<h3>00:05:36,601</h3>
<p>He came in clearly with a prepared line, which was candid is not for sale.</p>
<p>他显然准备了台词——“加拿大不出售”。</p>
<p>But then he had to sort of navigate not having a, you know, Zelensky type moment, with Trump where they're in a standoff.</p>
<p>但他还得避免与特朗普陷入泽连斯基式的对峙时刻。</p>
<p>He seemed to have.</p>
<p>他似乎做到了。</p>

<p>这非常有趣。</p>
<p>I mean, you you the only thing to compare it to is kind of the Zelensky on one end of the spectrum, the very far right.</p>
<p>唯一可类比的是光谱最右端的泽连斯基。</p>
<p>And then there's the British prime minister presenting the like a golden letter from the Buckingham Palace with like double plus good invitation, right.</p>
<p>另一端则是英国首相呈递白金汉宫金函、展现“双倍善意”邀请。</p>

<p>并非完全反对他，但偶尔在各自讲台时表达些分歧。</p>
<p>this is this is somewhere on that spectrum.</p>
<p>卡尼处于这个光谱的某处。</p>
<p>It is it is far closer to Keir Starmer, the British PM, than Zelensky.</p>
<p>更接近英国首相基尔·斯塔默而非泽连斯基。</p>

<p>I don't know if the thing about the real estate deal was a planned out, but it seemed like it sure sounded like it.</p>
<p>不确定房地产比喻是否预先设计，但听起来确实像。</p>
<p>and it was interesting to see the president kind of responding.</p>
<p>而总统的回应也很有趣。</p>
<p>Well, it's interesting, Anderson, because all of these foreign leaders do work.</p>

<h3>00:06:34,593</h3>
<p>I mean, it's not uncommon that you would workshop how you're going to handle meeting with a U.S. president, but the extent to which they all have to do some form of Prep, because they know they're going to end up in a bind with with President Trump.</p>
<p>为应对美国总统会晤做准备并不罕见，但他们现在必须做某种准备，因为他们知道最终会与特朗普总统陷入僵局。</p>
<p>He clearly had practice saying something that would both disarm Trump and also make his point.</p>
<p>卡尼明显练习过既能化解特朗普攻势又能表明立场的说辞。</p>
