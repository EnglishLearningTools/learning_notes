<h3>00:00:03,000</h3>
<p>Four and seven years ago, our fathers crossed the [Applause] north to be I am in my devotion [Music] to Hello, I am Larry Arn, president of Hillsdale College and I'm honored to welcome you to the Indian treaty room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, part of the White House complex.</p>
<p>四十七年前，我们的先辈穿越[掌声]北方，以表我的奉献[音乐]……大家好，我是希尔斯代尔学院校长拉里·阿恩，很荣幸欢迎你们来到白宫建筑群之一的艾森豪威尔行政办公楼的印第安条约室。</p>
<p>President Trump wishes to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence next year with an open heart.</p>
<p>特朗普总统希望以开放的心态庆祝明年《独立宣言》250周年。</p>

<h3>00:00:59,377</h3>
<p>The college is honored because it loves the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>学院深感荣幸，因为它热爱《独立宣言》。</p>
<p>Our oldest building was dedicated on the 4th of July in 1853.</p>
<p>我们最古老的建筑于1853年7月4日落成。</p>
<p>Then the president of the college at that time who became known to Abraham Lincoln gave a speech in which he said freedom and learning go together and ignorance and slavery go together.</p>
<p>当时的学院院长（后来与亚伯拉罕·林肯相识）发表演讲，称自由与学习相伴，无知与奴役相随。</p>

<h3>00:01:19,249</h3>
<p>One of the things we must do to commemorate anything commemorate just means to remember together first we have to know the thing and we can't remember it very well if we don't know it very well.</p>
<p>纪念某事首先意味着共同回忆，我们必须了解它，若了解不深，便无法深刻铭记。</p>
<p>And so part of the purpose of this series of lectures is to remember President Trump does this in part I think I don't speak for him but uh the word again is important to him.</p>
<p>因此，本系列讲座的部分目的是铭记——特朗普总统也在这样做（我不代表他发言），但“再次”一词对他很重要。</p>

<h3>00:01:45,624</h3>
<p>He has a famous slogan that I will not repeat here but everybody knows what it is and it ends with the word again.</p>
<p>他有一句著名口号（此处不重复），但人人皆知它以“再次”结尾。</p>
<p>He wants to do something again.</p>
<p>他想再次做某事。</p>
<p>Something already been done.</p>
<p>某事已被做过。</p>
<p>He wants to see it happen again.</p>
<p>他希望它再次发生。</p>
<p>This places him somewhere near the politics of Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>这使他的政治立场接近亚伯拉罕·林肯。</p>

<h3>00:02:08,491</h3>
<p>I think George Washington did something for the first time extremely honorable, including the defense of the Declaration of Independence on battlefields.</p>
<p>我认为乔治·华盛顿首次做了极其崇高的事，包括在战场上捍卫《独立宣言》。</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln comes along later and he wants to restore all of that.</p>
<p>亚伯拉罕·林肯后来出现，希望恢复这一切。</p>
<p>He took the view that that was a very hard thing to do, but it wasn't a new thing to do.</p>
<p>他认为这虽艰难，却非新事。</p>

<h3>00:02:29,244</h3>
<p>It was something that we should remember and commemorate.</p>
<p>这是我们应该铭记和纪念的事。</p>
<p>In introducing this series, I want to begin by uh encouraging you to read the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>在介绍本系列时，我想首先鼓励你们阅读《独立宣言》。</p>
<p>It's just over 1300 words long.</p>
<p>它仅1300余词。</p>
<p>It is one of the most consequential and beautiful political documents in all of history.</p>
<p>它是历史上最具影响力和优美的政治文献之一。</p>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top</a></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="block-7"></a></p>
<h3>00:02:52,374</h3>
<p>You should read it again and again.</p>
<p>你们应反复阅读。</p>
<p>You should memorize the beginning of it.</p>
<p>你们应背诵它的开头。</p>
<p>It's very beautiful.</p>
<p>它非常优美。</p>
<p>It is grand and eternal and eloquent and it reclaims the rights of us all.</p>
<p>它宏大、永恒、雄辩，重申了我们所有人的权利。</p>
<p>It begins universally when in the course that means anytime one people that means any people.</p>
<p>它以普世开篇——“当……时”（即任何时候），“一个民族”（即任何民族）。</p>

<h3>00:03:10,032</h3>
<p>It refers to the laws of nature and of nature's god.</p>
<p>它提及自然和自然神的法则。</p>
<p>Those would be eternal laws.</p>
<p>这些是永恒的法则。</p>
<p>Laws that we don't make laws that are ever and forever.</p>
<p>非我们制定的法则，而是永存的法则。</p>
<p>The terms the decor of independence means that it's true now.</p>
<p>“独立”的措辞意味着它现在仍成立。</p>
<p>If it was true then and it means that if it's not true now, it was not true then.</p>
<p>若当时为真，则若现在不真，当时亦不真。</p>

<h3>00:03:32,239</h3>
<p>It excludes any idea of a change in the fundamental conditions.</p>
<p>它排除了根本条件改变的可能性。</p>
<p>Absorb that and then go on to the next section.</p>
<p>理解这点，再继续下一部分。</p>
<p>The next section raises some claims against the king of England that justify our revolution.</p>
<p>下一部分列举了对英王的控诉，为革命正名。</p>
<p>The particular claim is that he has violated his rightful powers by invading the authority of the legislature which indicates separation of powers would be right and that he has interfered with representation.</p>
<p>具体指控他越权侵犯立法机构（表明分权正确），并干涉代表权。</p>

<p><a name="block-10"></a></p>
<h3>00:04:03,332</h3>
<p>Our ability to elect our government which means consent of the governed has been interfered with and he's interfered with the judicial branch.</p>
<p>我们选举政府的能力（即被统治者同意）遭干涉，他还干涉了司法部门。</p>
<p>separation of powers, consent of the governed, representation, those things were the very structure of the Constitution of the United States later made to defend the principles and institutionalize the principles of the Declaration of Independence according at least to those who wrote it and to later the very great Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>分权、被统治者同意、代表权——这些构成美国宪法的核心，旨在捍卫并制度化《独立宣言》原则（至少起草者和后来的亚伯拉罕·林肯如此认为）。</p>

<h3>00:04:32,319</h3>
<p>If you learn those things, it's a sort of guide to the understanding of American politics.</p>
<p>若理解这些，便掌握了美国政治的指南。</p>
<p>After the charges against the king comes a particular also very beautiful final section that becomes so particular it is confined at the end to the actual people in the room voting to approve the declarations of independence.</p>
<p>控诉英王后是尤为优美的结尾，最终聚焦于现场投票通过《独立宣言》的人们。</p>

<h3>00:04:55,023</h3>
<p>We mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor.</p>
<p>“我们以生命、财产和神圣荣誉相互宣誓。”</p>
<p>It starts out with all eternity and it ends up with with those people and that room and everything they have pledged to this eternal cause.</p>
<p>它以永恒开篇，以那些人、那间房和他们为永恒事业的誓言作结。</p>
<p>It becomes the American cause, the cause of our people formed under principles of all people by a resolution they made unto death to defend it.</p>
<p>这成为美国的事业——我们的人民在普世原则下立誓至死捍卫的事业。</p>

<h3>00:05:24,663</h3>
<p>That I think is the foundation stone of America right there.</p>
<p>我认为这正是美国的基石。</p>
<p>In the course of the American Revolution in April of 1775 in two villages in Massachusetts, a bunch of people, first about 70, then maybe 3,500, were called out to fire the shot heard around the world.</p>
<p>1775年4月美国革命期间，马萨诸塞州两村庄召集了一群人（先约70人，后约3500人），打响了“响彻世界的枪声”。</p>

<h3>00:05:51,918</h3>
<p>Several hundred British regulars were coming down the road to seize an arms depot and you might say assert the might of the British Empire and they gathered to stop them and they did.</p>
<p>数百名英军正沿路进军夺取军火库（可谓彰显大英帝国威力），他们集结阻击并成功了。</p>
<p>They were organized to do that.</p>
<p>他们是有组织行动的。</p>
<p>Somehow it wasn't just individuals rising up.</p>
<p>这并非仅是个人自发反抗。</p>

<p>They had already bound together to cooperate.</p>
<p>他们早已团结协作。</p>
<p>It's a very stirring story.</p>
<p>这是个激动人心的故事。</p>
<p>And we have the marvelous Bill Mcclelay, a colleague of mine, a historian, tremendous teacher.</p>
<p>我们请来了杰出的比尔·麦克莱——我的同事、历史学家、卓越教师。</p>
<p>He's one of our best.</p>
<p>他是我们中最优秀的之一。</p>
<p>He's uh written many books.</p>
<p>他著有多本书籍。</p>
<p>Uh he fell in love in history a long time ago after a classical education.</p>
<p>他早年接受古典教育后便爱上了历史。</p>

<h3>00:06:32,082</h3>
<p>And I can bend one of his books in particular to you.</p>
<p>我特别推荐他的一本书。</p>
<p>I think the best one volume history of the United States ever written is called Land of Hope.</p>
<p>我认为史上最佳单卷美国史是《希望之地》。</p>
<p>Listen to him and enjoy and think about your liberties and their structure and the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>聆听他的讲述，享受并思考你们的自由、其结构及《独立宣言》。</p>

<p>首讲关于那“响彻世界的枪声”。</p>
<p>It was April 19th, 1775.</p>
<p>那是1775年4月19日。</p>
<p>And Bill Mcclelay will tell us about it.</p>
<p>比尔·麦克莱将为我们讲述。</p>
